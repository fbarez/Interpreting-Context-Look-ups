The attention head is essential for predicting \"too\", which serves as an additive connector in these comparative and additional context.\nExample: \"\"\"\n clients love us, and we think you will too\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: "}], "max_tokens": 1}, {"id": "chatcmpl-89Hs62wGUHAH6hsgknMIBPFsrMLDO", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1697224342, "model": "gpt-4-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 134, "completion_tokens": 1, "total_tokens": 135}}]

In the inactive examples, 'they' is used within more complex sentences where the reference may not be as clear cut or the context involves interruptions or comparisons, making it more complicated for the attention head to predict.\nExample: \"\"\"\nOnce the colonies having the desired gene have  been identified they\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: "}], "max_tokens": 1}, {"id": "chatcmpl-89HuzspNW8nyo3UTodnLFt6ztpUAP", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1697224521, "model": "gpt-4-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 166, "completion_tokens": 1, "total_tokens": 167}}]

It seems that in these inactive cases, the \"them\" does not differentiate or select from amongst a larger group in a specific way. Instead, the \"them\" often refers generally to a group of entities without specifically singling some out or categorizing them, as seen in phrases like \"many of them\", \"almost all of them\", \"some of them\" etc.   Hence the attention head seems to be sensitive to contexts where 'them' is used for differentiation rather than just a generic way of referring to a group.\nExample: \"\"\"\n, of course, best known for his novels, many of them\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: "}], "max_tokens": 1}, {"id": "chatcmpl-89HvCv6hVnPmFSzYfy9zfTzVlb2iF", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1697224534, "model": "gpt-4-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "No"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 246, "completion_tokens": 1, "total_tokens": 247}}]
