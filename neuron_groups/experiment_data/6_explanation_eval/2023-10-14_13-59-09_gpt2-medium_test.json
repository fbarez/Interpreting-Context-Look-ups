It seems to capture the sense of singularity when the phrase \"one such\" or \"just such\" followed by any noun or activity is mentioned, indicating a particular 'example' of a wider context.   In inactive examples, while the word \"such\" is used, it is primarily used to refer to previously mentioned concepts or instances without suggesting a uniqueness or specificity of the instance, as in the active examples. In other words, the \"such\" in these cases doesn't spotlight a single instance as a representative or unique case of a more general concept. The attention head therefore seems to differentiate between these usages of \"such\".\nExample: \"\"\"\nBILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT  * (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF  * THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF such\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: ": "BILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT  * (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF  * THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF such"}, "(20, 2717, 238)": {"Is the given example an active example?

However, this pattern isn't foolproof, as there are examples where \"going\" is used following these phrases but the head remains inactive, so the specific content and context also play a role.

Examples include \"while on-the-go\", \"Fast Does A Hoverboard Go\", or \"the time goes along\". This suggests that this specific attention head is programmed to focus on contextual, figurative usage of the verb \"go\" rather than its literal, temporal or locative senses\nExample: \"\"\"\nWait a minute.\" \"Is this guy a real doctor?\" \" Of course he is.\" \" We need to move!\" \"Ben will receive the best possible care.\" \"You know the children are our most precious resource.\" \"Pam to ICU, please.\" \"Try to remain calm.\" \"Go ahead and look.\" \"There you go\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: ": "Wait a minute.\" \"Is this guy a real doctor?\" \" Of course he is.\" \" We need to move!\" \"Ben will receive the best possible care.\" \"You know the children are our most precious resource.\" \"Pam to ICU, please.\" \"Try to remain calm.\" \"Go ahead and look.\" \"There you go"}, "(23, 2725, 354)": {"Is the given example an active example?
