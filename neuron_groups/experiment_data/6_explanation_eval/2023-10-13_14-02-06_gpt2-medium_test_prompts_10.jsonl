{"model": "gpt-4", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is the given example an active example? (Yes/No)\nThe example is active when the example discusses or presents a contrast or comparison between things or situations, often using the words 'same' or 'comparable' as a reference point. Specifically, it highlights the concept of 'sameness' before introducing the idea of 'difference'. This could be a contrast between same and different events, practices, results, conditions, objects, entities, qualities, characteristics etc. This head appears particularly active when the differentiation is emphasized immediately after reaffirming or discussing similarity.  For example, the document could be comparing similar situations and noting how the outcomes are different, or it might be comparing similar objects and noting how they have different characteristics or properties. In the inactive examples, although 'different' is also often used, it isn't necessarily in the context of an immediate comparison or contrast with something that is 'same' or similar, which may explain why the attention head isn't active in those situations.\nExample: \"\"\"\n always take into account that // two different tags may represent different\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: "}], "max_tokens": 1}

It pays attention to cases where \u201cgo\u201d serves to complete the phrase or thought contextually rather than indicate physical movement or progress in time. For instance, in the examples \u201cwhere have all the workers go\u201d, \u201clet it go\u201d, \u201cthe theory go\u201d, and \u201cas far as capital cities go\u201d, the word \u201cgo\u201d is not used to represent literal motion or time progression.  However, the attention head is inactive when \"go\" is used to indicate physical movement, to express the passing of time, or in hyphenated on-the-go instances. Examples include \"while on-the-go\", \"Fast Does A Hoverboard Go\", or \"the time goes along\". This suggests that this specific attention head is programmed to focus on contextual, figurative usage of the verb \"go\" rather than its literal, temporal or locative senses\nExample: \"\"\"\n't let go *\" \"* I got a feeling that I can't let go\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: "}], "max_tokens": 1}
