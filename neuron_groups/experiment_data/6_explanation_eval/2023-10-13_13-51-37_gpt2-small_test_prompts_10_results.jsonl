(Yes/No)\nThe example is active when the example contains a sentence or a clause where someone assigns a specific name, designation or label to something or someone. The attention head seems to recognize instances where the author or a character is defining or re-naming things in quoted words or phrases followed by the word \"term\". It becomes inactive as in the last example when the naming or labeling is not directly made by someone rather it is referred as a conventional terminology ('nozzle') in a certain field (the art).\nExample: \"\"\"\nThe prominent young politician,\" as Obama was term\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: "}], "max_tokens": 1}, {"id": "chatcmpl-89Wm4hAYBHKLPhpLkkpyJPOrlLwuN", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1697281628, "model": "gpt-4-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 136, "completion_tokens": 1, "total_tokens": 137}}]

For the inactive examples, although some contain the word \"times\", they do not have the repeated event pattern or the direct following phrase \"this times\". Some of them also incorrectly end sentences with \"times\" which seems to not be recognized by the attention head.   In other words, the attention head is looking for phrases or context in which 'times' is used to indicate a similar or repeating situation, as opposed to just numerical repetitions (like 'several times') or incorrect grammatical usages (like 'the first times').\nExample: \"\"\"\n've ever known, even if it does make me nervous and cranky most of the times\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: "}], "max_tokens": 1}, {"id": "chatcmpl-89Wn8PcaGRYhPzUWZ2VahI0NPyJei", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1697281694, "model": "gpt-4-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "No"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 210, "completion_tokens": 1, "total_tokens": 211}}]

(Yes/No)\nThe example is active when the example is expressing frequency or rate with a structure that includes a numerical value directly followed by the term \"every\". This numerical quantity can be a number like 1, 2, 60 etc. or a percentage like 0.3% or 2%. It also seems to be looking for a specific structure where \"every\" is used to express recurring intervals like \"once every\", \"7 days every\", or \"0.3% every\".   In the inactive examples, despite containing the term \"every\", the attention head isn't triggered because either the term \"every\" isn't directly preceded by a numerical value or the numerical value doesn't directly follow the specific structures that the attention head is looking for. For instance, phrases such as \"on a every\", \"a every\", \"an almost every\" do not match the specific structure the attention head is looking for, hence it remains inactive.\nExample: \"\"\"\n The suicide rate as of 2017 is 26.4 suicides every\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: "}], "max_tokens": 1}, {"id": "chatcmpl-89WoCX1hMWaBORzh2IUpz6CIsJItV", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1697281760, "model": "gpt-4-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 231, "completion_tokens": 1, "total_tokens": 232}}]

In the active samples, there's a direct description of how something operates or accommodates within a certain context, showing functionality or compatibility. For instance, a phrase like \"the band fits you well\" is active because it's describing how the band fits.   In contrast, the head is inactive when the phrase with \"well\" is linked with interpersonal relations (\"got along well\"), an achievement or assessment (\"summed it up well\", \"serves him particularly well\") or when it is used in a more passive, less direct structure, especially when \"fitting well\" is not being directly related to performance, functionality, or compatibility.   For example, phrases like \"he fits in well\" or \"I hope Horns serves the kid just well\" are not active because these are more related to individuals integrating into a group or scenario rather than something fitting or functioning\nExample: \"\"\"\n but overall perform just as well\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: "}], "max_tokens": 1}, {"id": "chatcmpl-89WojwQnXlIFxlbXDBY7QMZaK6SuO", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1697281793, "model": "gpt-4-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "No"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 242, "completion_tokens": 1, "total_tokens": 243}}]

Given these phrases generally follow some kind of subject or event, this attention head likely aids in recognizing situations where the past participle \"made\" is needed to complete the sentence in a grammatically appropriate and semantically meaningful way. Since there appears to be no documents where the attention head is inactive, it's difficult to specify exact conditions under which it would be inactive, but it can be inferred that this would likely be the case in sentences that do not require the usage of the word \"made\" in a past participle manner following an event or subject.\nExample: \"\"\"\n Considerable advances have been made\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: "}], "max_tokens": 1}, {"id": "chatcmpl-89Wwc9yEwS7O8ktl51F5dinBiyc1Y", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1697282282, "model": "gpt-4-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 193, "completion_tokens": 1, "total_tokens": 194}}]
