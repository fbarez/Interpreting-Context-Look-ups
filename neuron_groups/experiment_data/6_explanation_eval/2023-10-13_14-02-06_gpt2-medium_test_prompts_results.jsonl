[{"model": "gpt-4", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is the given example an active example? (Yes/No)\nThe example is active when the example has a narrative or descriptive style, typically telling a story or explaining information in a more structured, formalized manner. This attention head is utilized when the discourse of the document is depicting a sequence of events or steps. For instance, it is active when sentences are providing a chronological recount of events, a process or introducing a new formation (like a company, corporation, website etc.).  Inactive examples, on the other hand, seem to be more informal, personal or interactive in nature. For instance, retelling personal actions (\"I started...,\" \"I joined...,\" \"I published...,\" \"I've been using...\"), or giving direct instructions or information to the reader.  Thus, context seems to be a key factor in the activation of the attention head. More report-style, impersonal and formal contexts activate it, whereas personal, interactive, or instructive contexts seem to keep it inactive.\nExample: \"\"\"\n new character, Lidia, voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro.

Interestingly, this attention head is not activated in the presence of a \"Not only... but...\" structure, where the usage of 'too' is also applying an action or sentiment to a second subject or object.\nExample: \"\"\"\n I can do it, you can do it too\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: "}], "max_tokens": 1}, {"id": "chatcmpl-89IKHOT4EinObd8ZfffcDKtjTeYdJ", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1697226089, "model": "gpt-4-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 245, "completion_tokens": 1, "total_tokens": 246}}]

Looking at the inactive examples, they also contain the token \"since\", but the context of their usage differs. In many of these examples, \"since\" is used similarly to provide context or reasoning, but there's a possibility that the model might be sensitive to the format or style of phrasing that could affect whether this head gets activated or not. This could include very complex sentences, idioms, non-traditional phrases, or certain topics or domains.  Another possible reason why the attention head is inactive in these examples could be if \"since\" is being used more to indicate a period of time rather than to provide a reason or cause, though this usage is less apparent in\nExample: \"\"\"\nitudes.

(Yes/No)\nThe example is active when the example contains the phrase \"not\" in a context of negation or denial, often in conjunction with a preceding/adjacent verb or conditional phrase. This allows the transformer to understand clauses where an action, state, or condition is rejected or negated. The attention head is inactive in examples where \"not\" is used in phrases that do not necessarily negate an action or proposition, but instead communicate absence or non-existence, or is part of a larger non-negating compound phrase such as \"not-null\" or \"not less than\". Additionally, it could be related other grammatical or contextual factors such as the presence of a specific auxiliary verb like \"could\" or \"do\", to create expressions like \"could not\" or \"do not\".\nExample: \"\"\"\n Brown, 54, died of apparent natural causes in the hospital at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman.

If the document does not end with these particular tokens, the head remains inactive. For instance, in the inactive examples, even though the token \"very\" is present, it does not follow one of the specific tokens that the attention head is tuned to recognize, such as \"D.\" or \"SUBS\" or \"NCH\", hence the attention head is inactive.\nExample: \"\"\"\nING_DESC_WITH_WARNING = CodegenConstants.MODEL_PROPERTY_NAMING_DES very\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: "}], "max_tokens": 1}, {"id": "chatcmpl-89IPLCKuGihU1XAd7KfQzEqNJWVi6", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1697226403, "model": "gpt-4-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "No"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 170, "completion_tokens": 1, "total_tokens": 171}}]
