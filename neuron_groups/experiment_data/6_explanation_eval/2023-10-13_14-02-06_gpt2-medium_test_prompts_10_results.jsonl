In the active examples, there's a value preceding the \"of\", such as \"torque handling limit\", \"recovery interval\", \"14 bullets\", \"blood pressure\", \"operating deficit\", \"operating loss\", and \"spectral resolving power\". On the other hand, the inactive examples either don't contain a numerical or quantifiable measurement preceding \"of\", or they have additional contextual factors around \"of\". This suggests that the attention head specifically identifies and reacts to instances where \"of\" follows a quantifiable or measurable term in the document, signaling the next token it should predict.\nExample: \"\"\"\n long jump field with a distance of\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: "}], "max_tokens": 1}, {"id": "chatcmpl-89XvafCUCV30IZJMKsUEY4D9BtNlR", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1697286062, "model": "gpt-4-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 173, "completion_tokens": 1, "total_tokens": 174}}]

It suggests that the term \"after\" is used to imply a continuous occurrence of the action mentioned prior to it.  However, in the inactive examples, although the word \"after\" appears, it does not necessarily denote a repeated or sequential activity as in the active examples. Instead, it is used in contexts such as prepositional phrases (e.g. \"look after\"), idiomatic expressions (e.g. \"sought-after\"), or as a phrase conjunction (e.g. \"after overcoming\").   In other words, this attention head is more active when the context around \"after\" represents a repeated or sequencing activity rather than its other possible usages.\nExample: \"\"\"\n are murdered one after\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: "}], "max_tokens": 1}, {"id": "chatcmpl-89XyV64Re58HU7x5VqgE20AHNEHHQ", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1697286243, "model": "gpt-4-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 216, "completion_tokens": 1, "total_tokens": 217}}]

In all the examples where the attention head is active, the last sentence or the closing remark is \"Thank you\".   However, when there's any token or sentence following \"Thank you\", or if \"Thank you\" is placed in the middle of a document or sentence, the attention head is not active, as seen in the inactive examples. For instance, in the phrase \"please re-blog, thank you\", there is a continuation after \"Thank you\", which makes the head inactive. Similarly, in \"Thank you for...\", \"Thank you\" is at the start of the sentence, making the attention head inactive. Also, when other words are added directly after \"Thank you\", like \"for...\", the head tends to be inactive.

[{"model": "gpt-4", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is the given example an active example? (Yes/No)\nThe example is active when the example mentions progress, ongoing occurrences or statuses up until the current point in time. For example, in the active examples, some phrases used were \"has issued so\", \"have been so\", \"most watched so\", \"has only played so\", which all indicate that something has been happening up to now. In these contexts, \"so\" can be replaced with \"thus far\", \"up until now\", \"as of the present moment\".  In contrast, in the inactive examples, the context around 'so' doesn't imply anything ongoing or up to the present moment. Rather, 'so' is used as a connector to complete a sentence or an idea. For instance, in 'Can he expect greater indulgence from the Iranians? The signs so', 'so' is used to connect the sentence to the idea proposed in the previous question.

The attention head also tends to activate when the preceding words terminate without a period sign. It remains inactive where the text before \" very\" contains specific location names like 'Washington, D', or complex scientific terms like 'EDC concentrations', or legal references. Essentially, it might be specialized to help predict \" very\" when it perceives certain structural or terminology-related patterns in a document.\nExample: \"\"\"\n tonight CANCELLED  This is weird, it's snowy outside, but not THAT bad. It's not like this is the blizzard of '78 or something. There's 6 inches at the most, probably less. Maybe the Bulls were extremely delayed or something.
