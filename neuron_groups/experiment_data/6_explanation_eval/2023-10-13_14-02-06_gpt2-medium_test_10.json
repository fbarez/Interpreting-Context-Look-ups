This head seems more related to finding instances where attempts or suggestions towards a solution, particularly in technical and programming contexts, are being made - often, when a previous approach has been unsuccessful. It is triggered by phrases indicating attempts and uncertainty like \"I tried\", \"seems to work\", \"might not work\", \"didn't work\" and so on. The key point is that the activity of the attention head is not determined by the certainty of whether something will work or not, but more so the discussion or question of its functionality. Meanwhile in inactive cases, the context often involves suggestions or phrases that seem definitive or certain about something working.\nExample: \"\"\"\n tried something like: <li class=\"{{ page.getChildren()|length == 0 ? 'dropdown-item' : 'dropdown-submenu' }}\">  If that doesn't work\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: ": " tried something like: <li class=\"{{ page.getChildren()|length == 0 ?

It focuses on identifying overall usage of \"off\" in various contexts: to convey the stopping/termination of something (turn off, switched off, powered off, set off), the beginning of an event or action (kicked off), the completion or exhaustion of something (wear off, wiped off) and other similar variations. It seems to be inactive when \"off\" is used as part of compound words or hyphenated phrases that alter the meaning (i.e., worn-off, kick-off, shut him off, turn-on). Also, it seems to be inactive when \"off\" is used with hyphen separating the activities such as in kick-off, grayed-off, laid-off, etc.\nExample: \"\"\"\n War picks up where Avengers: Age of Ultron left off\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: ": " War picks up where Avengers: Age of Ultron left off"}, "(11, 2274, 129)": {"Is the given example an active example?

Given these phrases generally follow some kind of subject or event, this attention head likely aids in recognizing situations where the past participle \"made\" is needed to complete the sentence in a grammatically appropriate and semantically meaningful way. Since there appears to be no documents where the attention head is inactive, it's difficult to specify exact conditions under which it would be inactive, but it can be inferred that this would likely be the case in sentences that do not require the usage of the word \"made\" in a past participle manner following an event or subject.\nExample: \"\"\"\n Considerable advances have been made\n\"\"\"\nAnswer: ": " Considerable advances have been made"}, "(11, 2046, 131)": {"Is the given example an active example?
