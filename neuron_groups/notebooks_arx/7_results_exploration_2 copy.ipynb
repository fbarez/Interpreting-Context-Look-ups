On the other hand, in inactive examples, the word \"only\" is used in different contexts, without a clear specific condition or purpose preceding it.\n",

      "   The head is active when the document mentions a specific type of class or provides context or details about the class, such as an adjective describing the class (e.g., \"yoga,\" \"music appreciation,\" or \"gender studies\") or information about the class's schedule, frequency, or level (e.g., \"evening classes,\" \"once-a-week,\" or \"introductory general physics\"). In the inactive examples, the class is often referred to more generally or lacks specific context or details (e.g., \"an aerobics class,\" \"regularly attended yoga class,\" or \"skipped class\").\n",
