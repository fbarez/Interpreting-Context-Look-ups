(31, 2918, 505), ' go', 1.0
This head is active when contains the phrase "come and go" or variations of it, which implies a focus on things or events that happen temporarily, periodically, or cyclically. In these active examples, the attention head is likely picking up on the idea of change or transience. In the inactive examples, the phrase "come and go" or similar variations are not present, and instead, the word "go" is used in different contexts (such as comparisons, movement, or progress). As a result, the attention head is not active since the context it specializes in is not relevant in these examples..

(31, 4378, 123), ' together', 1.0
This head is active when ends with the phrase "Taken together." It seems to be specifically looking for this phrase at the end of a document to predict the last token "together." In the inactive examples, even though the word "together" appears in various contexts, it is not preceded by the word "Taken," and thus the attention head remains inactive. The attention head is sensitive to the specific context of "Taken together" and does not activate for other variations or uses of the word "together.".

(34, 4262, 505), ' down', 1.0
This head is active when contains phrases or sentences with a context where the words "up" and "down" are used as opposite directions, actions, or states. The active examples involve contrasts in directions or a change between the two states (up and down), such as "mouse wheel, up and down," "interest rates would then simply move up or down," and "build people up, and we like to tear them down." In the inactive examples, the use of "down" primarily refers to a single action or state without the contrasting "up" context or doesn't follow a pattern of up and down, such as "gunned down," "flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him...I am the true bread that came down," and "turning it upside down.".

(34, 4199, 645), ' after', 1.0
This head is active when contains the phrase "sought- after" or a similar variation with a hyphen, such as "extremely sought- after" and "widely sought- after." In the inactive examples, the word "after" is not preceded by a hyphenated word or phrase, and often follows the phrases "look after" or "come after," among others. Thus, it seems that the presence of a hyphenated phrase with "after" is the key factor in activating this particular attention head..

(34, 4199, 538), ' after', 1.0
This head is active when contains a pattern where a word or a phrase is followed by a hyphen and the word "after". It seems to focus on situations where the term "sought-after" is used with a modifier (such as "most sought-after" or "extremely sought-after"). In the inactive examples, either the word "after" is not preceded by a hyphen or it is used with different words and contexts, such as in "look after" or "going after"..

(34, 727, 645), ' under', 1.0
This head is active when contains the phrase "free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify" followed by some optional symbols or characters, and then "it under". The attention head seems to be looking for a pattern where the statement about free software and its redistribution and modification is mentioned, and then leading up to the phrase "it under". The presence of optional symbols or characters like '*', '%', '#', and '//' do not seem to impact its activation, but it does rely on the specific wording and structure of the statement. In the inactive examples, either the key phrase is not present or has been modified (like the use of a semicolon instead of a colon), or the context of the document is different (talking about rugs, age restrictions, etc.) without containing the required pattern for activation..

(35, 274, 123), ' サーティ', 1.0
This head is active when contains a word or phrase that is either abbreviated, truncated, or an incomplete term, and requires the last token "サーティ" to be appended in order to form the complete word or phrase. The attention head recognizes patterns of such incomplete terms present in the document and assists in predicting the completion of the term.

For example, in the active cases, we can see phrases like "Immunop サーティ" where "Immunop" is an abbreviation for "Immunoprecipitation", or "periodontal plastic surgery to create ging サーティ", where "ging" is an incomplete word for "gingival". The attention head detects these incomplete words or abbreviations and gets activated, predicting the addition of "サーティ" to form the complete terms.

In the inactive case, there is no such pattern detected and hence the attention head remains inactive..

This head is active when contains an action, event, or introduction that occurred in the past, indicated by phrases such as "signed into law last", "introduced a new version of the bill last", "pleaded guilty last", "released last", "speech at New York Law School last", or "resigned abruptly last", among others. In the inactive examples, the focus is on the release or publication of certain information ("released last" and "published last"), which does not entail a specific action or event happening in the past. The attention head seems to be more active when identifying actions or events that have a more direct impact on a situation, person, or organization rather than just the sharing or publishing of information..

This head is active when contains a phrase or sentence that is followed or concluded by the term "as" in a way that it provides additional or comparative information. The attention head is focusing on contexts where "as" is used to indicate similarity, manner or reason.

In the active examples, "as" is used to link two ideas or pieces of information, often describing a situation, characteristic, or quality. For instance, in the first example, the attention head is active because the phrase "We'll email you as soon as" is used to indicate when an action will occur in relation to another event.

In the inactive examples, "as" is often used in different contexts, such as enumerating examples (e.g., "such as"), indicating a time frame (e.g., "as early as"), or expressing conditions (e.g., "so long as"). In these cases, the attention head does not activate because the usage of "as" does not present additional, comparative, or concluding information about the context.

This head is active when contains a phrase describing a position or action related to "after," but without specifying an exact point in time (such as "shortly after" or "months after"). In the active examples, the attention head highlights phrases like "a space after," "before and after," and "looking after," which focus on the spatial or relational aspect of "after." In the inactive examples, the documents use phrases like "shortly after," "seven months after," or "immediately after," which specify a more exact point in time.

This head is active when contains a term, name, or concept followed by a comma and the word "also" or "sometimes" before the token "called". In these cases, it identifies an alternative name or term for a particular subject. In the inactive examples, the context surrounding the token "called" does not follow this pattern, and instead, "called" is used in different ways such as referring to something someone called it, what is sometimes called, or explaining a condition without the specific "also called" pattern..

This head is active when refers to a context of personal development, growth or change in circumstances, or has a narrative aspect related to someone's background or personal history. It usually involves a sense of progression or transformation over time. In the active examples, we see phrases like "growing up," "where they grew up," and "how I ended up", which are connected to personal stories or experiences in the past leading to present situations.

In the inactive examples, although some sentences contain the word "up", they don't have the same context. These examples refer to different subjects such as bitcoin prices, physical descriptions, or sharing information about an event.

This head is active when contains phrases or sentences where the term "down" is used in the context of direction, movement, or a change in state or value. It focuses on scenarios where something is physically moving down, decreasing in value, or experiencing a decline.

In the active examples, we can see phrases like "going down," "rot down," "up or down," "turning it upside down," and "move up or down." These all convey a sense of direction, movement, or change in value.

In contrast, the inactive examples have different contexts where "down" is used, such as in phrases like "handed down," "gunning down," "clamp down," or "step down." These instances do not represent a change in direction, movement, or value in the same way as the active examples.

This head is active when contains phrases that end with "way" and are used to describe a certain method, approach, or perspective. In these instances, "way" often appears immediately after words like "this," "that," or "either," and the sentences generally express an opinion or perspective on a given topic. In the inactive examples, the word "way" is used more literally to denote distance, direction, or as part of an idiom or a more complex phrase. Essentially, the attention head is activated when "way" is used as a figurative expression to represent a concept or method, rather than its literal meaning..

This head is active when contains the structure "same" followed by a noun or verb, followed by "over and over" or just "over and over" without other additional actions or elements. In some cases, it may also be active when there's a repeated action or element in the document.

In the inactive examples, the attention head does not seem to be active because it does not follow the specific structure observed in the active examples. For instance, "repeats the same line over and over" switches the order of "repeats" and "the same", and phrases like "I repeat over and over" or "Remembering it over and over" do not include the word "same" in the structure. Moreover, in the example with "% year over year", the context is different, and "over" appears within a different phrase, not in the context of repetitive actions or elements..

In the active examples, the attention head recognizes a combination of words, symbols, or phrases that signal the end of a sentence or statement, followed by the token "of". In most of these cases, the sentences have a slightly formal or legal tone, or deal with licensing and terms of use.

On the other hand, the inactive examples lack that specific pattern or structure.

In the inactive examples, even though some of them have the last token as " no", the context does not refer to a U.S. patent. This attention head is not active in these cases as the attention head is specifically triggered by references to U.S. patents..

This head is active when contains phrases like "it turns out," "as it turns out," "read on to find out," or "to find out" that indicate a revelation or discovery is about to be explained or shared. These phrases usually appear at the end of sentences or paragraphs, leading to a conclusion or moment of understanding.

In the inactive examples, phrases like "let's find out," "turns out" (without the preceding "it"), and "it turned out" do not perfectly match the patterns observed in the active examples. Additionally, these inactive examples might also lack the context of a revelation or explanation to follow, making the attention head inactive..

In the active examples, we can see "as" is usually followed by words like "such as," "so long as," or "as well as." These phrases give additional context or information about the preceding text.

In the inactive examples, the attention head is not active because "as" is mainly used to indicate a temporal relationship (e.g. "as early as," "as soon as," "as fast as") or is followed by a simple preposition or conjunction with less informative value. In these cases, the attention head might not be necessary to understand the general context or to predict the appearance of "as" in the document..

This head is active when contains a phrase or sentence in which the word "by" plays a significant role in the meaning, often as a preposition, indicating a particular action, method, or rule. In the active examples, "by" appears in contexts such as "plays by," "order by," "moveView by," and "originally posted by." In these cases, "by" is an essential part of the expression, contributing to its meaning.

In the inactive examples, "by" appears as a standalone word or preposition that does not significantly contribute to the context it is in, such as "Email Sign Up by" or "Pay by." In these instances, the word "by" is not part of a larger, meaningful expression or phrase, and therefore, the attention head is not activated..

This head is active when contains phrases implying a combination, joining, or merging of two or more elements or ideas. In the active examples, we can see expressions like "bring these two worlds together", "put two and two together", "glue all of the pipe sections together", which suggest a process of combining or connecting things.

In the inactive examples, the word "together" is often used in a different context or doesn't play a central role in the action of combining things. For instances, phrases like "used together", "in turn leads to", "taken together", and "coming together" do not convey the same sense of merging or joining things as in the active examples. In some cases, "together" is part of a longer phrase such as "healthcare leaders, technology experts, and visionaries together", which is structurally different from the active examples..

This head is active when contains the word "only" at or near the end of a sentence or phrase and is used to emphasize a singular purpose, reason, or exclusivity. In the active examples, "only" is found either at the end of the sentence or closely following a clause which emphasizes a specific purpose (e.g., "for educational purposes only" or "known only").

In the inactive examples, although the word "only" is present, it does not hold the same emphasis on exclusivity or it is located at other positions in the text and not near the end. The context of "only" in inactive examples is often connected to being part of a condition or limitation (e.g., "can only work if you are following" or "only available in Mexico") and not used as a singular emphasis on purpose or reason..

In the active examples, phrases like "trying far too", "take it way too", "don't tighten the nut too", "not a moment too", and "pushing himself too" show that the attention head is focused on situations where the excessive degree of something is significant. In the inactive examples, the usage of "too" is either part of a larger expression (e.g., "going into too much graphic detail") or is not emphasizing the excessive degree of an action (e.g., "I have way too"). As a result, the attention head is not activated in those cases..

(32, 4964, 517), ' too', 0.5
This head is active when contains a phrase or structure that indicates a limit or a threshold being reached or approached, often in the context of an action, condition or advice. Additionally, it seems like the head is more sensitive to phrases that are close to the end of the document.

In the active examples, the attention head is triggered by phrases such as "don't tighten the nut too", "if it takes too", "pushing himself too", "allowed to drop too", and "before it's too". In each of these, the phrase indicates a situation where something is being pushed towards or beyond its acceptable or desired limit.

In the inactive examples, there are instances where the word "too" is being used, but it either doesn't convey the same sense of reaching or approaching a limit, or is not near the end of the document. For example, in "you’ll look like you’re trying far too", the expression "far too" is more about expressing an extreme degree rather than approaching a limit..

This head is active when discusses a situation or event that is happening again or has the potential to happen again, usually after a certain period of time or due to some specific circumstances. In these cases, the word "once" is often used to emphasize the recurrence, repetition, or another chance for this event or situation. The attention head seems to be triggered by phrases that express the idea of revisiting, returning, or repeating an event or situation.

In most of the active examples, words or phrases such as "again", "new decade", "after", "back", or "yet" are used in the sentences, which signal a recurring or repetitive theme. In the inactive example, the sentence doesn't imply any sense of repetition or recurrence in the context provided, thus not activating the attention head..

(33, 3278, 538), ' around', 0.5
This head is active when contains the word "around" as the last token, and it has a sense of being related to a broader group of people, places, or things. Essentially, the attention head is activated when "around" is used to convey a sense of sharing, spreading, or activities happening in multiple locations. 

In the active examples, "around" is often used to emphasize a broader context, like activities or opinions that are prevalent among people or things in various places. For example, "hockey fans around," "radio stations around," or "wars against legitimate governments all around."

In the inactive examples, "around" is typically used in different contexts, such as indicating a direction (e.g., "to turn things around"), quantifying resources (e.g., "food to go around"), or a specific group (e.g., "Muslims around"). Although "around" is the last token in these instances, it doesn't convey the broader sense that activates the attention head..

(33, 1299, 492), ' last', 0.5
This head is active when mentions an action or event that occurred in the past, specifically when it is followed by a time expression "last". In inactive examples, the attention head is not activated because either the time expression "last" is not present or even if it is present, it does not refer to an action or event that just occurred but rather to a more general context, such as signing a law or releasing a book. The active examples tend to have a more specific action or event that had taken place..

(33, 52, 123), ' by', 0.5
This head is active when contains a phrase or sentence that ends with "by" and is not part of a larger clause or expression. In the active examples, "by" appears as the last word before punctuation, a line break, or the end of the document, and often follows a pattern where it signifies the conclusion of a statement, action, or attribution (e.g., "Email Sign Up by", "events/news...listed below by", "selected to Pay by"). 

In contrast, the inactive examples show "by" as part of a larger expression or sentence and is often followed by additional words or clauses (e.g., "plays by his own rules", "Get started today by", "ran for the Conservatives in a by", "super(Order by", "self.moveView by"). In these cases, "by" is within a continuous textual flow and not serving as an ending token..

This head is active when contains a pattern where a word or a phrase is followed by a hyphen and the word "after". It seems to focus on situations where the term "sought-after" is used with a modifier (such as "most sought-after" or "extremely sought-after"). In the inactive examples, either the word "after" is not preceded by a hyphen or it is used with different words and contexts, such as in "look after" or "going after"..

This head is active when contains a specific description, opinion, or series of attributes related to the subject (usually a person), and the last token "His" serves as an indication that the next part of the text will provide additional information or examples supporting the preceding statements. In the inactive examples, the context of "His" is not related to supporting evidence or further elaboration on a certain aspect of the subject, but rather a continuation or connection to another point in the text..

(35, 274, 88), ' サーティ', 0.5
This head is active when contains a word or phrase that is either abbreviated, truncated, or an incomplete term, and requires the last token "サーティ" to be appended in order to form the complete word or phrase. The attention head recognizes patterns of such incomplete terms present in the document and assists in predicting the completion of the term.

For example, in the active cases, we can see phrases like "Immunop サーティ" where "Immunop" is an abbreviation for "Immunoprecipitation", or "periodontal plastic surgery to create ging サーティ", where "ging" is an incomplete word for "gingival". The attention head detects these incomplete words or abbreviations and gets activated, predicting the addition of "サーティ" to form the complete terms.

In the inactive case, there is no such pattern detected and hence the attention head remains inactive..

This head is active when has a structure that builds suspense or curiosity within the reader by using phrases like "turns out," "find out," or "read on." Usually, these phrases appear near the end of the document and indicate that a revelation or result is about to be disclosed. In the examples provided, the active attention head is triggered by these phrases as they create a sense of anticipation for the last token "out." In the inactive examples, the attention head remains inactive because these phrases - or a similar mechanism to generate suspense - are either absent or placed differently within the document, thus not contributing to the prediction of the last token "out.".

This head is active when describes a specific state or condition that is typically temporary, unusual, or altered from the normal state. It is most likely activated when the context surrounding the word "state" gives an indication of an uncommon or altered situation. 

In the active examples, we can see that the states described are often temporary or unusual, such as "coma-like state," "trance-like state," or "catatonic state." On the other hand, in the inactive examples, the states mentioned are more standard, normal, or expected, such as "initial ground state," "inactive state," or "hydrated state.".

This head is active when contains phrases that indicate a revelation, discovery, or suspense about the outcome of a situation or information. In the active examples, the phrases like "turns out," "find out," and "it turns out" are used, which indicate that the reader is about to learn something new or there's a sense of anticipation. In the inactive examples, these elements of revelation or suspense are missing, so the attention head remains inactive..

In the active examples, the attention head focuses on phrases that are providing details such as age, length, value, height, or duration.

This head is active when contains a phrase indicating an excessive or extreme aspect, such as "far too," "way too," or "pushing himself too." In these instances, the attention head helps to predict the last token as "too." This attention head is likely focusing on contextual patterns that suggest an emphasis on excessive amounts or actions. In the inactive examples, the term "too" is still present, but it may not be associated with an emphasized extreme or excess, and therefore the attention head remains inactive..

This head is active when discusses a specific event, prediction, or scientific estimation related to time, usually involving a significant period (years, stages of development, or fiscal years) or a major subject matter (ancestors, evolution, milestones). In the active examples, the content tends to be more formal or technical and involves some evaluation or assessment. In contrast, the inactive examples are more casual or narrative and describe daily events or timeframes in a more informal manner, such as a person arriving at a location or an unremarkable period of time passing..

This head is active when contains a statement or fact that is limited or restricted by the term "only". In the active examples, the attention head is highlighting a specific context or scenario where something is exclusive or unique. For example, "Excersire can only work if you are following a proper diet" implies that exercise alone is not enough.

In the inactive examples, the term "only" is often used to emphasize the sole purpose or aspect of something rather than indicating exclusivity or a limitation in a broader context. For example, "for one reason and one reason only" uses "only" to stress that there is just one reason, but it doesn't indicate a unique or restrictive situation that the attention head would look for..

This head is active when contains a phrase where "after" appears at the end, and it serves as a function word that usually precedes a verb or proposition, indicating a sense of following or pursuing something. In the inactive examples, "after" is part of hyphenated compound adjectives such as "sought-after," which serve as modifiers, or it is followed by additional information, thus not being the last token in those instances..

This head is active when contains a phrase or a structure that leads to an ending with "by" without it being a part of a code, a title, or an incomplete sentence. In the active examples, we see the attention head being triggered by phrases like "Email Sign Up by", "step by", "help with this form", "installment of the SWD", etc., where "by" naturally follows the preceding words and completes the sentence or thought. 

In the inactive examples, we see that the head is not active when "by" is a part of a code, title, an incomplete sentence, or embedded within other words or phrases. For instance, in the examples like "class OrderBy(PipelineOperation)", "self.moveView by", "All fields marked with * are required", "new String[]{"Пока", "Прощай"};" and "early days of ZX Spectrum they didn't, but by", the attention head is inactive because "by" may not necessarily be the last.

This head is active when contains a context where the term "down" is used to describe a decrease, decline, movement, or change in direction, rather than referring to a physical action like being pulled or gunned down. The active examples involve concepts like decisions being handed down, innovation declining, test takers decreasing, interest rates moving up or down, and yields being flat or slightly down. In contrast, the inactive examples involve usage of "down" in contexts such as being gunned down, clamping down, turning upside down, and watering down, which are not related to a decrease or changing direction in the same conceptual sense..

This head is active when contains a name or description for something, followed by a comma and the word "also" or a similar word (like "sometimes" or "as it came to be"), and then the word "called." The attention head is looking for instances where an alternate name or term is being introduced for a particular subject, concept or thing.

In the inactive examples, the head is not active because either "called" is not the last word, or the context doesn't contain an alternate name introduction in the format observed in the active examples.

This head is active when mentions a comparison or a ratio with the term "as much" used to quantify the extent of difference between two things or situations. In the active examples, we can see that the attention head is looking for scenarios where there is a comparison with "as much" such as "three times as much," "ten times as much," or "increase the effective size by as much." However, in the inactive examples, the term "much" is used in different contexts that do not involve a direct comparison or ratio, such as "without going into too much," "one of a kind, we put so much," or "already causing too much.".

This head is active when describes an action, attempt or process, often related to software, technology, or programming, that leads to a specific outcome indicated by the mention of "the following." In most active examples, the documents explain a user's experience or attempt in doing something that results in an outcome or a list of items. In the inactive examples, though some documents share the similar context or mention "the following," the attention head is not triggered, likely due to lack of a clear action, attempt, or process that leads to an outcome or the lack of an explicit mention of "the following" as an outcome..

(31, 988, 558), ' called', 0.25
This head is active when contains a phrase where a specific term, concept, or mechanism is introduced and then immediately defined or referred to using the term "called." In other words, the attention head is activated when there is a direct association between a previously mentioned item and the term "called." 

In the inactive examples, the term "called" is often preceded by an additional descriptor (e.g., "also called" or "sometimes called"), or the association between the preceding concept and the term "called" is not as direct or immediate. This difference in structure or phrasing may be the reason why the attention head remains inactive in these cases..
