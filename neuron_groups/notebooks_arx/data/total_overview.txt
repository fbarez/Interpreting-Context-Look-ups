This head is active when contains a phrase indicating a specific purpose or intention, generally followed by the word "only". In the active examples, the attention head recognizes patterns such as "for...purposes only", "for reference purposes only" or "for entertainment purposes only", highlighting a limitation or restriction on the information or content provided. In the inactive examples, the word "only" is either used differently in the context, such as "only available", "only going to increase", or "known only", or it is used as a part of multiple reasons and purposes, making it difficult for the attention head to identify a distinct pattern..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains the word "only" at or near the end of a sentence or phrase and is used to emphasize a singular purpose, reason, or exclusivity. In the active examples, "only" is found either at the end of the sentence or closely following a clause which emphasizes a specific purpose (e.g., "for educational purposes only" or "known only").

In the inactive examples, although the word "only" is present, it does not hold the same emphasis on exclusivity or it is located at other positions in the text and not near the end. The context of "only" in inactive examples is often connected to being part of a condition or limitation (e.g., "can only work if you are following" or "only available in Mexico") and not used as a singular emphasis on purpose or reason..

This head is active when contains a statement or fact that is limited or restricted by the term "only". In the active examples, the attention head is highlighting a specific context or scenario where something is exclusive or unique. For example, "Excersire can only work if you are following a proper diet" implies that exercise alone is not enough.

In the inactive examples, the term "only" is often used to emphasize the sole purpose or aspect of something rather than indicating exclusivity or a limitation in a broader context. For example, "for one reason and one reason only" uses "only" to stress that there is just one reason, but it doesn't indicate a unique or restrictive situation that the attention head would look for..

In the inactive examples, the use of "go" is more related to comparisons (e.g., "as far as capital cities go"), temporal changes (e.g., "seems to come and go"), or simple descriptions (e.g., "on-the-go") without strongly suggesting a specific action or direction..

In the inactive examples, even though the word "together" appears in various contexts, it is not preceded by the word "Taken," and thus the attention head remains inactive. The attention head is sensitive to the specific context of "Taken together" and does not activate for other variations or uses of the word "together.".

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when mentions an action or process that involves combining, connecting, or assembling things or ideas. In the active examples, we see phrases like "come together," "tie together," "glue together," and "merge projects," which all indicate a joining or unification of elements. In the inactive examples, though some documents mention "together" and seem related to combining/connecting, they often use "taken together" as a phrase to connect different scientific findings, which doesn't involve the action of physically or conceptually bringing separate elements into a unified whole, and is more of a summarization or linking of findings..

This head is active when contains phrases implying a combination, joining, or merging of two or more elements or ideas. In the active examples, we can see expressions like "bring these two worlds together", "put two and two together", "glue all of the pipe sections together", which suggest a process of combining or connecting things.

In the inactive examples, the word "together" is often used in a different context or doesn't play a central role in the action of combining things. For instances, phrases like "used together", "in turn leads to", "taken together", and "coming together" do not convey the same sense of merging or joining things as in the active examples. In some cases, "together" is part of a longer phrase such as "healthcare leaders, technology experts, and visionaries together", which is structurally different from the active examples..

This head is active when contains a phrase or concept that is being referred or defined using the term "called" without using the structure "also called". In other words, the attention head activates when "called" is used to introduce or explain a term, concept, or phenomenon, rather than as a way to provide an alternative name for something.

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when uses words or phrases like "also called," "as it came to be called," or "sometimes called" directly before the last token "called." It seems to be more focused on identifying instances where an alternative name or term is given immediately before the word "called."

In the inactive examples, the word "called" is often preceded by phrases such as "what he called," "what is sometimes called," "a condition called," or "sometimes called" with additional information in between, making this attention head inactive in those cases. The difference between active and inactive examples relies on the presence or absence of a direct attributive phrase preceding the token "called.".

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains a name or description for something, followed by a comma and the word "also" or a similar word (like "sometimes" or "as it came to be"), and then the word "called." The attention head is looking for instances where an alternate name or term is being introduced for a particular subject, concept or thing.

In the inactive examples, the head is not active because either "called" is not the last word, or the context doesn't contain an alternate name introduction in the format observed in the active examples. There might be similar phrasing or the word "called" present, but the overall structure does not meet the specific pattern that activates this attention head..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains a phrase where a specific term, concept, or mechanism is introduced and then immediately defined or referred to using the term "called." In other words, the attention head is activated when there is a direct association between a previously mentioned item and the term "called." 

In the inactive examples, the term "called" is often preceded by an additional descriptor (e.g., "also called" or "sometimes called"), or the association between the preceding concept and the term "called" is not as direct or immediate. This difference in structure or phrasing may be the reason why the attention head remains inactive in these cases..

This head is active when contains phrases indicating an initial discovery, achievement, or action, such as "for the first", "in the first", or similar variations. These phrases typically imply that something is happening or being reported for the first time. In contrast, the attention head is inactive when the document contains phrases like "first things first" or "meeting for the first", which do not focus on a novel or first-time occurrence. In summary, the attention head is activated by the context of an initial discovery or action, making it more likely to predict the last token as " first" in these situations..

This head is active when refers to a new or initial occurrence, discovery, or experience of a particular thing or event, usually indicated by phrases like "for the first" or "here first." In the active examples, the subject is often described to be occurring for the first time, a report or description is being made about it, or a new insight is presented. In contrast, the attention head is inactive when "first" is used as a standalone word without any connection to a specific event or experience, or when the "first" phrase is not implying the novelty of an occurrence or discovery..

This head is active when mentions a change or transformation in the subject's state or condition over time. It gets activated when the context implies that something was different in the past compared to the present situation, especially when the change is significant or impactful. In the active examples, we can notice shifts in vision, organizational culture, geographical indications, recognition, or the buzz surrounding releases. In the inactive examples, the focus is more on getting used to something or adapting to a current state rather than highlighting a substantial change in the subject..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains phrases that end with "way" and are used to describe a certain method, approach, or perspective. In these instances, "way" often appears immediately after words like "this," "that," or "either," and the sentences generally express an opinion or perspective on a given topic. In the inactive examples, the word "way" is used more literally to denote distance, direction, or as part of an idiom or a more complex phrase. Essentially, the attention head is activated when "way" is used as a figurative expression to represent a concept or method, rather than its literal meaning..

For example, in active documents, phrases like "this way" or "that way" are used either metaphorically or to describe methods, whereas in inactive documents, "way" is mostly used in phrases like "all the way" or "other way," describing a physical or literal spatial context or referring to reversal or opposites..

This head is active when contains phrases like "it turns out," "as it turns out," "read on to find out," or "to find out" that indicate a revelation or discovery is about to be explained or shared. These phrases usually appear at the end of sentences or paragraphs, leading to a conclusion or moment of understanding.

In the inactive examples, phrases like "let's find out," "turns out" (without the preceding "it"), and "it turned out" do not perfectly match the patterns observed in the active examples. Additionally, these inactive examples might also lack the context of a revelation or explanation to follow, making the attention head inactive..

This head is active when has a structure that builds suspense or curiosity within the reader by using phrases like "turns out," "find out," or "read on." Usually, these phrases appear near the end of the document and indicate that a revelation or result is about to be disclosed. In the examples provided, the active attention head is triggered by these phrases as they create a sense of anticipation for the last token "out." In the inactive examples, the attention head remains inactive because these phrases - or a similar mechanism to generate suspense - are either absent or placed differently within the document, thus not contributing to the prediction of the last token "out.".

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains a phrase where "too" is used to emphasize an excessive degree of a particular action or quality. In the active examples, phrases like "trying far too", "take it way too", "don't tighten the nut too", "not a moment too", and "pushing himself too" show that the attention head is focused on situations where the excessive degree of something is significant. In the inactive examples, the usage of "too" is either part of a larger expression (e.g., "going into too much graphic detail") or is not emphasizing the excessive degree of an action (e.g., "I have way too"). As a result, the attention head is not activated in those cases..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains a phrase or structure that indicates a limit or a threshold being reached or approached, often in the context of an action, condition or advice. Additionally, it seems like the head is more sensitive to phrases that are close to the end of the document.

In the active examples, the attention head is triggered by phrases such as "don't tighten the nut too", "if it takes too", "pushing himself too", "allowed to drop too", and "before it's too". In each of these, the phrase indicates a situation where something is being pushed towards or beyond its acceptable or desired limit.

In the inactive examples, there are instances where the word "too" is being used, but it either doesn't convey the same sense of reaching or approaching a limit, or is not near the end of the document. For example, in "you’ll look like you’re trying far too", the expression "far too" is more about expressing an extreme degree rather than approaching a limit..

This head is active when contains a phrase indicating an excessive or extreme aspect, such as "far too," "way too," or "pushing himself too." In these instances, the attention head helps to predict the last token as "too." This attention head is likely focusing on contextual patterns that suggest an emphasis on excessive amounts or actions. In the inactive examples, the term "too" is still present, but it may not be associated with an emphasized extreme or excess, and therefore the attention head remains inactive..

This head is active when mentions "will" in a context that implies choice, flexibility, or control. In the active examples, "will" is used to convey decision-making, changing at one's discretion, or expressing an opinion. In the inactive examples, "will" is often associated with more fixed scenarios, such as legal documents (like a last will and testament), predetermined events, or passive contexts..

This head is active when ends with "right" or "right right" without referring to a specific time, event, or situation related to the future. In the inactive examples, the attention head is not active because the sentences mostly mention a specific time (for example, "10 years from right"), involve future events (like "dividend 3 years from right"), or talk about a particular situation, player or place (such as "MVP playing right right" or "Ring of Honor right right")..

This head is active when contains the structure "same" followed by a noun or verb, followed by "over and over" or just "over and over" without other additional actions or elements. In some cases, it may also be active when there's a repeated action or element in the document.

In the inactive examples, the attention head does not seem to be active because it does not follow the specific structure observed in the active examples. For instance, "repeats the same line over and over" switches the order of "repeats" and "the same", and phrases like "I repeat over and over" or "Remembering it over and over" do not include the word "same" in the structure. Moreover, in the example with "% year over year", the context is different, and "over" appears within a different phrase, not in the context of repetitive actions or elements..

This head is active when contains phrases that indicate a revelation, discovery, or suspense about the outcome of a situation or information. In the active examples, the phrases like "turns out," "find out," and "it turns out" are used, which indicate that the reader is about to learn something new or there's a sense of anticipation.

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when discusses a situation or event that is happening again or has the potential to happen again, usually after a certain period of time or due to some specific circumstances. In these cases, the word "once" is often used to emphasize the recurrence, repetition, or another chance for this event or situation. The attention head seems to be triggered by phrases that express the idea of revisiting, returning, or repeating an event or situation.

In most of the active examples, words or phrases such as "again", "new decade", "after", "back", or "yet" are used in the sentences, which signal a recurring or repetitive theme. In the inactive example, the sentence doesn't imply any sense of repetition or recurrence in the context provided, thus not activating the attention head..

This head is active when contains phrases implying some action, event, or emotion directed towards "her" or involving "her" in a more prominent way. In the active examples, we can observe actions like "ILOE her", "push her", "give it to her", "tell her", or "attempts to rape her". Also, some phrases show a stronger emotional connection or focus on "her", like "think of her every second" or "support from those around her". 

In the inactive examples, although "her" is present, it is not associated with a significant action, emotion, or event. Instead, these instances mostly talk about situations or descriptions involving "her". For instance, "she had forgotten to ask", "send today", or "drawing conclusions" do not create a strong focus on the token "her". Overall, the attention head becomes active when "her" has a prominent role in the context of the document, mainly linked to actions or emotions directed towards "her"..

In the active examples, the attention head is triggered by phrases like "as much," "so much," and "too much," which show the degree or intensity of the described factor or action. In inactive examples, although some texts also contain the word "much," the attention head is not activated because these instances do not emphasize a particular extent or degree in the same way as the active examples..

This head is active when includes a quantifiable aspect (numbers, counts, rankings, or comparisons) or the document mentions an achievement, outcome, or progress being made. In the active examples, we can observe various references to numerical data or progress being made:

- "...222 units built so"
- "...netted nine goals for the campaign so"
- "...accruing just $710 so"
- "...32 months in office so"
- "...628 confirmed cases and 165 probable cases so"

On the other hand, in inactive examples, the documents are generally more focused on explaining a problem, attempt, opinion, or a process without highlighting specific quantifiable aspects or achievements..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when mentions a change, condition, or description related to the state of an object, person, or system. In the active examples, the state is often referred to as inactive, non-conducting, or current, and sometimes includes descriptions like inebriated or catatonic. In contrast, the inactive examples often focus on a more technical description of the state, like hydrated, unfolded, locked, or ketosis, and the state is not characterized by a change or transition in condition..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when refers to a specific condition or status of an object, often involving a change, maintenance, or prediction of that state. In the active examples, the attention head recognizes phrases like "locked state," "retracted state," and "current state," which imply a change in the state or the significance of the particular state in the context. In the inactive examples, the state is described more passively or is inherent to the subject, such as "hydrated state," "partially unfolded state," and "ketosis – a state." The attention head seems to be more focused on recognizing transitions, manipulations, or importance of a specific state rather than just the existence of a particular state..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when describes a specific state or condition that is typically temporary, unusual, or altered from the normal state. It is most likely activated when the context surrounding the word "state" gives an indication of an uncommon or altered situation. 

In the active examples, we can see that the states described are often temporary or unusual, such as "coma-like state," "trance-like state," or "catatonic state." On the other hand, in the inactive examples, the states mentioned are more standard, normal, or expected, such as "initial ground state," "inactive state," or "hydrated state.".
Examples where the head is active:
✅  due to her poor nutritional and overall debilitated state
✅  the lighter. In general, this improvement has alleviated some of the fears associated with leaving the lighter in an "unlocked", operable state
✅  come forward, telling gardaí she was in a distressed state
✅  wood in an almost pristine state
✅  site worked great! Restoring the site to yesterdays state
❌  activation, Drosophila Shaker K+ channels enter a nonconducting, inactivated state
❌  mutation, and the P35A mutation is presented in the context of differences in chemical shifts, the differences in NOE patterns, and structural changes resulting from oxidation of the reduced cytochrome. G34S is substantially destabilized relative to wild-type (2.2 kcal/mol in the oxidized state

❌  nanosecond [@prospects]. This Letter describes a search for GMSB in which gaugino pairs are produced and quickly decay to the $\gamma\gamma$$+$$\mett$$+$$X$ final state
❌  latch 12 is in the latched state
❌  and triplet excited states were involved in the photochemical behavior of CYA. The laser flash photolysis experiments clearly showed the involvement of the triplet excited state
❌  Root rot, if left untreated, can cause rapid tree decline and death. Trees sometimes live for many months in a weakened state
❌  ion channels can either be inactivated from this open state by an additional conformational change which leads to a nonconducting state
❌  folding reaction. However, lysozyme can continuously fold from unfolded state
❌  spins are affected. After the field is turned off, the protons decay to the original spin-down state

Examples where the head is inactive:
✅  spin of the ground state is $I^\pi = 4^+$, but this level is very close to a $3^+$ excited state
✅ , keeping valves 12 and 17 in the closed state
✅  ground state. Several techniques can be envisaged to prepare an atomic chain in the ground state

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when discusses a specific event, prediction, or scientific estimation related to time, usually involving a significant period (years, stages of development, or fiscal years) or a major subject matter (ancestors, evolution, milestones). In the active examples, the content tends to be more formal or technical and involves some evaluation or assessment. In contrast, the inactive examples are more casual or narrative and describe daily events or timeframes in a more informal manner, such as a person arriving at a location or an unremarkable period of time passing..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when mentions an event, action, or development happening at a specific point in time or from a certain point in the past, and the last token "about" is used to indicate an approximate time frame or period. In the active examples, the attention head focuses on situations that involve historical events, species evolution, or geographical changes with a vague time reference using "about".

In the inactive examples, the documents contain mentions of specific events, situations, or descriptions, but the context around "about" does not refer to an approximate time frame or historical period. Instead, "about" is used to describe quantities, measurements, or specific moments, which are not the primary focus of this attention head..

This head is active when describes a situation or context where an issue, error, or message is received or encountered, and the word "following" is used to introduce the specific error, message, or information. In most active examples, the word "following" is preceded by the phrases "I receive," "I get," or "it gives me," indicating that the information being described comes after or as a result of the mentioned action or context. In the inactive examples, the word "following" is instead often used to refer to additional information or details that don't necessarily result from a specific action or context but are still relevant, or to describe a certain condition or state..

This head is active when contains a situation or problem that results in an outcome, usually an error message, a list, or a specific condition. Often, these active examples include phrases like "getting the following," "receiving the following," "I get the following," or "fails with the following." In contrast, the attention head is inactive when the document contains a description of code, data, or a scenario without explicitly mentioning an outcome or result. In these cases, the phrases used do not indicate that there is a particular outcome for which the attention head needs to be active..

This head is active when describes an action, attempt or process, often related to software, technology, or programming, that leads to a specific outcome indicated by the mention of "the following." In most active examples, the documents explain a user's experience or attempt in doing something that results in an outcome or a list of items. In the inactive examples, though some documents share the similar context or mention "the following," the attention head is not triggered, likely due to lack of a clear action, attempt, or process that leads to an outcome or the lack of an explicit mention of "the following" as an outcome..

This head is active when mentions a distribution or spreading of something (e.g., influence, presence, or actions) on a wide or global scale, often connected with the phrase "around the world" or simply "around". It tends to be inactive when the context is more focused on changing a situation or direction (e.g., turn things around), referring to a specific action/location (e.g., fly halfway around), or when "around" is used to emphasize the impact or presence of something within a vicinity or among individuals (e.g., Keep Calm and Carry On, no matter what is going on around)..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains the word "around" as the last token, and it has a sense of being related to a broader group of people, places, or things. Essentially, the attention head is activated when "around" is used to convey a sense of sharing, spreading, or activities happening in multiple locations. 

In the active examples, "around" is often used to emphasize a broader context, like activities or opinions that are prevalent among people or things in various places. For example, "hockey fans around," "radio stations around," or "wars against legitimate governments all around."

In the inactive examples, "around" is typically used in different contexts, such as indicating a direction (e.g., "to turn things around"), quantifying resources (e.g., "food to go around"), or a specific group (e.g., "Muslims around"). Although "around" is the last token in these instances, it doesn't convey the broader sense that activates the attention head..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when mentions an action or event that occurred in the past, specifically when it is followed by a time expression "last". In inactive examples, the attention head is not activated because either the time expression "last" is not present or even if it is present, it does not refer to an action or event that just occurred but rather to a more general context, such as signing a law or releasing a book. The active examples tend to have a more specific action or event that had taken place..

This head is active when contains a phrase or sentence in which the word "by" plays a significant role in the meaning, often as a preposition, indicating a particular action, method, or rule. In the active examples, "by" appears in contexts such as "plays by," "order by," "moveView by," and "originally posted by." In these cases, "by" is an essential part of the expression, contributing to its meaning.

In the inactive examples, "by" appears as a standalone word or preposition that does not significantly contribute to the context it is in, such as "Email Sign Up by" or "Pay by." In these instances, the word "by" is not part of a larger, meaningful expression or phrase, and therefore, the attention head is not activated..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains a phrase or sentence that ends with "by" and is not part of a larger clause or expression. In the active examples, "by" appears as the last word before punctuation, a line break, or the end of the document, and often follows a pattern where it signifies the conclusion of a statement, action, or attribution (e.g., "Email Sign Up by", "events/news...listed below by", "selected to Pay by"). 

In contrast, the inactive examples show "by" as part of a larger expression or sentence and is often followed by additional words or clauses (e.g., "plays by his own rules", "Get started today by", "ran for the Conservatives in a by", "super(Order by", "self.moveView by"). In these cases, "by" is within a continuous textual flow and not serving as an ending token..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains a phrase or a structure that leads to an ending with "by" without it being a part of a code, a title, or an incomplete sentence. In the active examples, we see the attention head being triggered by phrases like "Email Sign Up by", "step by", "help with this form", "installment of the SWD", etc., where "by" naturally follows the preceding words and completes the sentence or thought. 

In the inactive examples, we see that the head is not active when "by" is a part of a code, title, an incomplete sentence, or embedded within other words or phrases. For instance, in the examples like "class OrderBy(PipelineOperation)", "self.moveView by", "All fields marked with * are required", "new String[]{"Пока", "Прощай"};" and "early days of ZX Spectrum they didn't, but by", the attention head is inactive because "by" may not necessarily be the last.

This head is active when refers to an action or process related to toggling, switching, or changing between states, often represented by words like "on," "off," "switch," "turn," or alternating states. In inactive examples, the context in which "off" appears is not related to these actions or processes, instead representing concepts like discounts, detaching, or distances. The attention head recognizes the patterns associated with the toggling or switching actions, and thus becomes active in those specific documents..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains a phrase where "off" is used to convey a more abstract meaning or as part of an idiomatic phrase, rather than simply describing a physical or mechanical action such as turning something off, taking something off, or getting a discount. In the active examples, "off" is used as part of a comparative expression (e.g., "better off", "worse off"), as part of a phrasal verb (e.g., "paid off"), or to describe a non-continuous action (e.g., "on and off"). In the inactive examples, "off" is mostly used in more literal or mechanical contexts such as offering discounts, turning on/off devices, or describing locations or object states..

This head is active when contains a phrase or expression in which "off" is part of a larger idiomatic or compound meaning, such as "20% off," "one-off donation," "blow the lid off," "shirts off their backs," or "jerk off." In contrast, it's inactive when "off" is used in a more literal sense, such as in "switch on/off," "better off," "worse off," "turn-off voltage," or "take-off." Essentially, this attention head is sensitive to context and is activated when "off" is part of a figurative or compound expression..

This head is active when contains a phrase or sentence where the word "off" is directly related to an action, event, or process that is happening or about to happen. The attention head seems to be focusing on instances where "off" is part of a verb phrase or has a clear effect on the context.

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains phrases or sentences with a context where the words "up" and "down" are used as opposite directions, actions, or states. The active examples involve contrasts in directions or a change between the two states (up and down), such as "mouse wheel, up and down," "interest rates would then simply move up or down," and "build people up, and we like to tear them down." In the inactive examples, the use of "down" primarily refers to a single action or state without the contrasting "up" context or doesn't follow a pattern of up and down, such as "gunned down," "flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him...I am the true bread that came down," and "turning it upside down.".

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains phrases or sentences where the term "down" is used in the context of direction, movement, or a change in state or value. It focuses on scenarios where something is physically moving down, decreasing in value, or experiencing a decline.

In the active examples, we can see phrases like "going down," "rot down," "up or down," "turning it upside down," and "move up or down." These all convey a sense of direction, movement, or change in value.

In contrast, the inactive examples have different contexts where "down" is used, such as in phrases like "handed down," "gunning down," "clamp down," or "step down." These instances do not represent a change in direction, movement, or value in the same way as the active examples. Instead, they refer to different actions or situations that are not directly related to the attention head's focus on directional or value changes..

This head is active when contains a phrase suggesting some form of action or change being completed, often involving force or conflict in the context, and ends with "down" as the last token. In the active examples, there is a sense of activity, such as "being gunned down," "clamp down," "watered it down," or "tear them down." In the inactive examples, "down" is not necessarily the outcome of a completed action, event, or change, but rather a part of the general text that might refer to direction, description, or measurement..

This head is active when contains a context where the term "down" is used to describe a decrease, decline, movement, or change in direction, rather than referring to a physical action like being pulled or gunned down. The active examples involve concepts like decisions being handed down, innovation declining, test takers decreasing, interest rates moving up or down, and yields being flat or slightly down. In contrast, the inactive examples involve usage of "down" in contexts such as being gunned down, clamping down, turning upside down, and watering down, which are not related to a decrease or changing direction in the same conceptual sense..

This head is active when mentions a decrease or reduction in a certain aspect, context, or situation. The attention head is focused on identifying phrases and words implying the lowering or decreasing status of something. For example, "handed down," "going down," "went way down," "rot down," or "flat to down." 

On the other hand, the attention head is inactive in the examples where there is no mention of a reduction or decrease or where the term "down" is used in a different context, such as "gunned down," "aimed to clamp down," "up or down," "upside down," or "step down." These examples either depict a different action or merely use "down" as part of another expression, unrelated to decreasing or lowering..

This head is active when refers to a context of personal development, growth or change in circumstances, or has a narrative aspect related to someone's background or personal history. It usually involves a sense of progression or transformation over time. In the active examples, we see phrases like "growing up," "where they grew up," and "how I ended up", which are connected to personal stories or experiences in the past leading to present situations.

In the inactive examples, although some sentences contain the word "up", they don't have the same context. These examples refer to different subjects such as bitcoin prices, physical descriptions, or sharing information about an event. The sense of personal growth or change in circumstances is absent, and the attention head remains inactive in these cases..

This head is active when contains a reference to a U.S. Patent followed by the word "no". The pattern observed in the active examples is that they all include the phrase "U.S. Pat. no" just before the last token " no". In the inactive examples, the last token is still " no", but there is no mention of a U.S. Patent in the context or it is referred to differently (e.g., "patent application Ser. no" or "S. application Ser. no"). This pattern suggests that the attention head is specifically looking for references to U.S. Patents to help predict the last token as " no"..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when mentions a reference to "U.S. Pat. no" – referring to a United States Patent number. In the active examples, the common pattern is the presence of "U.S. Pat. no" before the last token " no". This attention head is likely trying to predict the " no" token as a part of the patent reference. 

In the inactive examples, even though some of them have the last token as " no", the context does not refer to a U.S. patent. This attention head is not active in these cases as the attention head is specifically triggered by references to U.S. patents..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains the phrase "sought- after" or a similar variation with a hyphen, such as "extremely sought- after" and "widely sought- after." In the inactive examples, the word "after" is not preceded by a hyphenated word or phrase, and often follows the phrases "look after" or "come after," among others. Thus, it seems that the presence of a hyphenated phrase with "after" is the key factor in activating this particular attention head..

This head is active when contains the phrase "free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify" followed by some optional symbols or characters, and then "it under". The attention head seems to be looking for a pattern where the statement about free software and its redistribution and modification is mentioned, and then leading up to the phrase "it under". The presence of optional symbols or characters like '*', '%', '#', and '//' do not seem to impact its activation, but it does rely on the specific wording and structure of the statement. In the inactive examples, either the key phrase is not present or has been modified (like the use of a semicolon instead of a colon), or the context of the document is different (talking about rugs, age restrictions, etc.) without containing the required pattern for activation..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains a phrase or sentence that is followed or concluded by the term "as" in a way that it provides additional or comparative information. The attention head is focusing on contexts where "as" is used to indicate similarity, manner or reason.

In the active examples, "as" is used to link two ideas or pieces of information, often describing a situation, characteristic, or quality. For instance, in the first example, the attention head is active because the phrase "We'll email you as soon as" is used to indicate when an action will occur in relation to another event.

In the inactive examples, "as" is often used in different contexts, such as enumerating examples (e.g., "such as"), indicating a time frame (e.g., "as early as"), or expressing conditions (e.g., "so long as"). In these cases, the attention head does not activate because the usage of "as" does not present additional, comparative, or concluding information about the context.

This head is active when contains a phrase in which "as" is followed by an informative descriptive word or phrase, often indicating a comparison, a condition, or a reference to a specific category or example. In the active examples, we can see "as" is usually followed by words like "such as," "so long as," or "as well as." These phrases give additional context or information about the preceding text.

In the inactive examples, the attention head is not active because "as" is mainly used to indicate a temporal relationship (e.g. "as early as," "as soon as," "as fast as") or is followed by a simple preposition or conjunction with less informative value. In these cases, the attention head might not be necessary to understand the general context or to predict the appearance of "as" in the document..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains phrases referring to opening and closing actions or operations, particularly in the context of commands, processes, or mechanisms. In the inactive examples, the word "close" appears mostly in different contexts, such as time-related phrases (e.g., "after the polls close"), statements (e.g., "Case close"), or unrelated situations (e.fastation: adult flies e close). The attention head does not activate in these cases because the context is not related to the opening and closing actions that it focuses on..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains a phrase or sentence that refers to a situation, action, or event that is not likely to happen or that is conditional. The active examples have sentences with negative expressions or conditions, which imply an uncertain or unlikely outcome, and this is where the attention head is seeking a prediction for the word "won". In the inactive examples, the context does not express the same level of uncertainty or conditionality, making the attention head inactive..

This head is active when contains a situation, condition, or reason that leads to a negative outcome or an inability for something to happen. In the active examples, there are specific circumstances or reasons that cause the subject or action not to work, or to fail, which is often followed by the word "won." On the other hand, in the inactive examples, the word "won" is used without any explicit condition or situation implying that something will not happen. The attention head focuses on identifying situations or conditions that lead to the negative outcome denoted by "won.".

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains a phrase where "high" is used in the context of having a positive or elevated quality or level, rather than just a quantitative measure or a plain description. In the active examples, "high" is used in situations like achieving a goal, holding a head up with pride, or reaching a certain quality. In contrast, the inactive examples mostly use "high" in a quantitative measure (like percentages, years, and values) or as part of a compound noun like "high school diploma" or "Haryana high", which doesn't convey an achieved elevation or quality..

This head is active when contains the word "very" towards the end of the sentence or phrase, often preceded by a descriptive phrase or expression, such as "at the very", "by its very", "by their very", "to say the very" or "from the very". These examples indicate the importance or extremity of the situation or statement being discussed. In contrast, the attention head is inactive when the document simply contains the word "very" being used as an adverb to emphasize the degree of an adjective or another adverb, often repeated twice, like "very, very". These inactive examples do not convey the same importance or extremity as the active examples but rather focuses on modifying and intensifying the meaning of a word that follows..

This head is active when contains the word "very" as the last token and it is part of a phrase or sentence expressing emphasis, intensity or an extreme quality. It seems that the head is not activated when there are repetitions of the word "very" or when "very" is not used for emphasis or as an intensifier. Additionally, it may not be as sensitive to instances where "very" is used in a more specific or technical context, such as the last inactive example mentioning "classroom by its very.".

This head is active when contains the word "very" near the end of the text and is often preceded by a contextual phrase, such as "at the very," "by its very," or "to say the very." In other words, the attention head is activated when the last token ("very") contributes to a meaningful phrase in the context of the document. The inactive examples do not have such context surrounding the word "very" towards the end, and therefore the attention head remains inactive..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains a reference to a person's action, behavior, thoughts, or characteristics, without providing explicit details about that person in the preceding text. It usually emphasizes the individual's attributes, motivations, or a specific aspect of their personality or actions.

This head is active when contains a specific pattern or structure that is related to the context where the last token should be "of." In the active examples, the attention head recognizes a combination of words, symbols, or phrases that signal the end of a sentence or statement, followed by the token "of". In most of these cases, the sentences have a slightly formal or legal tone, or deal with licensing and terms of use.

On the other hand, the inactive examples lack that specific pattern or structure. They are generally shorter, more casual sentences, or just a fragment, without the word combinations or context that activate the attention head. As a result, the attention head does not need to predict, or is unable to predict, that the last token would be "of" based on the given information..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains a word or phrase that is either abbreviated, truncated, or an incomplete term, and requires the last token "サーティ" to be appended in order to form the complete word or phrase. The attention head recognizes patterns of such incomplete terms present in the document and assists in predicting the completion of the term.

For example, in the active cases, we can see phrases like "Immunop サーティ" where "Immunop" is an abbreviation for "Immunoprecipitation", or "periodontal plastic surgery to create ging サーティ", where "ging" is an incomplete word for "gingival". The attention head detects these incomplete words or abbreviations and gets activated, predicting the addition of "サーティ" to form the complete terms.

In the inactive case, there is no such pattern detected and hence the attention head remains inactive..

This head is active when contains specific keywords or phrases related to scientific or medical contexts, such as "PCR mutagenesis," "transcription," "secondary metabolism," "cell signaling," "immunop," "mycot," and "periodontal plastic surgery." In contrast, the attention head is inactive in documents that do not contain such specific keywords or phrases, or when they appear to be incomplete or truncated (e.g., "-3 immunop" or "ting and immunop"). It seems that the attention head is focusing on the presence of complex or specialized terms to predict the last token as "サーティ"..

For example, in the active cases, we can see phrases like "Immunop サーティ" where "Immunop" is an abbreviation for "Immunoprecipitation", or "periodontal plastic surgery to create ging サーティ", where "ging" is an incomplete word for "gingival". The attention head detects these incomplete words or abbreviations and gets activated, predicting the addition of "サーティ" to form the complete terms.

In the inactive case, there is no such pattern detected and hence the attention head remains inactive..
Examples where the head is active:
✅ ambiar la velocidad de batalla y dupl サーティ
