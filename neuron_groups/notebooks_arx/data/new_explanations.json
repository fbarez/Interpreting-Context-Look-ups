The attention head is also active when the passage discusses a publication, like a study, article, or report, or an organization like the World Health Organization.</explanation>\n\nIn contrast, the attention head is inactive when the document mainly discusses general topics, events, concepts, or statements without explicitly pointing to a source, author, or context, such as universal basic income, plant-based diets, or coworking spaces.", "(35, 2369, 493)": "contains a complete sentence or a coherent idea that provides context or background information. The attention head seems to be sensitive to the presence of well-formed statements, regardless of whether proper nouns or specific names are used. In the active examples, the attention head appears to recognize the text as carrying a complete and coherent message that could be relevant to predicting the next token being \"The.\"\n\nIn the inactive examples, the attention head is not active because these examples may lack a fully developed statement or context, and often contain short phrases, colloquial expressions, or social media references. This indicates that the attention head is more focused on detecting coherent and informative content for the prediction task, rather than proper nouns and specific names.</explanation>", "(35, 2369, 554)": "contains a sentence or phrase that precedes a context where the mention of a specific title, organization, or location starting with the word \"The\" is likely. The attention head predicts the occurrence of \"The\" in the upcoming text and prepares the neural network to process that information. However, it does not necessarily require the actual presence of such entities in the text for activation.</explanation>\n\nWith the revised explanation, the reasoner categorizes the following examples of documents that activate this attention head:\n\nExamples where the attention head is active:\n\"\"\"\n*Julie recently visited an art exhibition, and she couldn't stop talking about the amazing gallery.\n*Kevin loves playing his favorite video games; one of his all-time favorites is quite popular.\n*Rachel enjoys watching talk shows, and there is one that covers celebrity news she particularly likes.\n*The local community center offers workshops, and there's a popular printmaking technique class.\n*Aspiring theologians often pursue their studies at a famous institution that focuses on", "(35, 2369, 600)": "does not contain specific contextual information or a setting that requires specifying a certain subject, event, or location. In the inactive examples, most of them include details about places, events, or subjects, such as visiting theme parks, renowned architecture, historical figures, and exciting experiences. These specific examples were initially assumed to require the attention head to predict \"The\" as the next token, but the new evidence shows that the attention head is actually inactive in these cases.\n\nOn the other hand, in the active examples, the text contains more general information, personal preferences, or everyday activities, such as reading, music choices, and daily routines. These examples lack the specific context or reference that was previously thought to necessitate the use of \"The.\" Instead, these general statements do not require the attention head to be active in order to predict the subsequent token. This indicates that the attention head may be more focused on detecting general, non-specific contexts rather than specific references and settings.</explanation>", "(35, 4638, 106)": "contains keywords or phrases that imply power, authority, influence, or high-level technology, as well as other contexts that involve achievements, significant events, and personal experiences. In the active examples, we see mentions of \"CEO,\" \"powerful GPU,\" \"President Biden,\" \"large companies,\" and even \"state championship in basketball\" and \"mesmerizing pianist's performance.\" The attention head is triggered by terms or context that suggest a sense of accomplishment, impact, or something noteworthy. In contrast, the inactive examples focus on topics like specific products, historical figures, or cutting-edge technology that do not encompass a broader notion of power, influence, or achievement.</explanation>", "(35, 4638, 88)": "mentions power or control in various contexts, such as social movements, organizational goals, data privacy, energy, and electricity. Examples of active instances include discussions on the struggle for power, access to resources as a symbol of power, information control impacting power dynamics, and instances of electrical power and outages. In contrast, the inactive examples focus on subjects like empowerment, political balance, defense, sustainable energy sources, and other topics that do not directly reference power or control in the same way as the active instances.</explanation>"}
