This head is active when contains a statement or fact that is limited or restricted by the term "only". In the active examples, the attention head is highlighting a specific context or scenario where something is exclusive or unique. For example, "Excersire can only work if you are following a proper diet" implies that exercise alone is not enough.

In the inactive examples, the term "only" is often used to emphasize the sole purpose or aspect of something rather than indicating exclusivity or a limitation in a broader context. For example, "for one reason and one reason only" uses "only" to stress that there is just one reason, but it doesn't indicate a unique or restrictive situation that the attention head would look for..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)This head is active when contains phrases implying a combination, joining, or merging of two or more elements or ideas. In the active examples, we can see expressions like "bring these two worlds together", "put two and two together", "glue all of the pipe sections together", which suggest a process of combining or connecting things.

In the inactive examples, the word "together" is often used in a different context or doesn't play a central role in the action of combining things. For instances, phrases like "used together", "in turn leads to", "taken together", and "coming together" do not convey the same sense of merging or joining things as in the active examples. In some cases, "together" is part of a longer phrase such as "healthcare leaders, technology experts, and visionaries together", which is structurally different from the active examples..

## Max Activating Examples from The Pile ('test' set)
This head is active when contains a phrase or sentence in which the word "by" plays a significant role in the meaning, often as a preposition, indicating a particular action, method, or rule. In the active examples, "by" appears in contexts such as "plays by," "order by," "moveView by," and "originally posted by." In these cases, "by" is an essential part of the expression, contributing to its meaning.

In the inactive examples, "by" appears as a standalone word or preposition that does not significantly contribute to the context it is in, such as "Email Sign Up by" or "Pay by." In these instances, the word "by" is not part of a larger, meaningful expression or phrase, and therefore, the attention head is not activated..

This head is active when refers to an action or process related to toggling, switching, or changing between states, often represented by words like "on," "off," "switch," "turn," or alternating states. In inactive examples, the context in which "off" appears is not related to these actions or processes, instead representing concepts like discounts, detaching, or distances. The attention head recognizes the patterns associated with the toggling or switching actions, and thus becomes active in those specific documents..

This head is active when contains a phrase or expression in which "off" is part of a larger idiomatic or compound meaning, such as "20% off," "one-off donation," "blow the lid off," "shirts off their backs," or "jerk off." In contrast, it's inactive when "off" is used in a more literal sense, such as in "switch on/off," "better off," "worse off," "turn-off voltage," or "take-off." Essentially, this attention head is sensitive to context and is activated when "off" is part of a figurative or compound expression..

This head is active when mentions a decrease or reduction in a certain aspect, context, or situation. The attention head is focused on identifying phrases and words implying the lowering or decreasing status of something. For example, "handed down," "going down," "went way down," "rot down," or "flat to down." 

On the other hand, the attention head is inactive in the examples where there is no mention of a reduction or decrease or where the term "down" is used in a different context, such as "gunned down," "aimed to clamp down," "up or down," "upside down," or "step down." These examples either depict a different action or merely use "down" as part of another expression, unrelated to decreasing or lowering..
