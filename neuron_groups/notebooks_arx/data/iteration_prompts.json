It focuses more on relative positions and temporal relationships between events or items in the document.

In contrast, the inactive examples mostly do not emphasize a specific time or sequence in the same way. While there might be some phrases with a temporal or sequence aspect (like \"Shortly\"), they are not as strongly connected to other words or phrases indicating temporal/sequential relationships.
