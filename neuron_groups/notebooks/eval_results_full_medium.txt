(20, 3243, 289), ' made', 1.0
This head is active when  includes references to decisions, choices, or attempts being made or needing to be made. The different examples indicate that it doesn't necessarily focus on who is making the decision, attempt, or choice, but rather the act of making itself. It seems to be particularly sensitive to phrases where "made" is the final word. The head is also active in documents where "made" appears after verbs like "is", "was", "to be", "need to be", "can be". Even in grammatically incorrect sentences such as "What difference would that made", the head is active, suggesting that it's looking for patterns of word use rather than strictly correct grammar..
Examples where the head is active:

(21, 1299, 312), ' over', 1.0
This head is active when  contains repetitive phrases that specifically use "over and over" or "quarter over quarter", "year over year". It seems to be trained to identify patterns of repetition related to the token "over". This could potentially be useful in contexts where reiteration or recurring occurrences are important.   On the other hand, this head is inactive in instances where "over" is used predominantly in spatial, controlling or dominance related contexts such as "victory over", "control over" or "one religion over another". These are situations where the word "over" is used, but not in a repetitive or cyclical context..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  the same thing over and over
✅  the same one over and over

(21, 1299, 274), ' over', 1.0
This head is active when  shows a repetition or redundancy, specifically when it indicates something is happening repeatedly with the use of the phrase "over and over". It appears that the attention head is predictive of the token "over" when it is part of this idiomatic expression.   On the other hand, in the inactive examples, "over" is used in a variety of ways, such as indicating a position above something, an end or conclusion, surpassing something, during a period of time, or indicating preference or dominance. None of these uses involve the concept of repetition or redundancy, which seems to trigger the attention head specifically..

(21, 1468, 16), ' time', 1.0
This head is active when  mentions an event or action that is happening "for the first time". It is sensitive to phrasing indicating a novel occurrence or action. For inactive examples, we don't see this kind of narrative; they are either presenting an event in a timely manner or describing a simultaneous happening. Therefore, the mention of " time" in these inactive examples doesn't relate to a first occurrence or novelty, which explains this attention head's inactivity..

This head is active when  contains a specific phrase that talks about something being distributed with the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty. This phrase seems to be commonly used in licensing agreements for software or similar content. The key components triggering the head's activity seem to be the mention of 'distributed', 'hope', 'useful', 'without', 'warranty', and these words are often structured in a similar pattern across different documents.

In the active examples, "it" is referencing something specific that has been clearly established before in the short document, such as the bent fork or the film under discussion.

This head is active when  mentions a point in time or a status and is followed by "after", in terms of indicating a period of time following a specific event or moment. For instance, "shortly after", "not long after", "sought-after". It seems the head is looking for prepositions before "after" or sequences that indicate temporal relationship with "after".   This head is inactive where "after" is used in different contexts or accompanied by different words. For example, phrasal verbs like "looked after", "looking after", or instances where "after" is used in calculations or comparisons of time or moments, e.g. "What is 596 minutes after 12:36 PM?", or clauses like "after creating your first dashboard"..

This head is active when  contains phrases referring to intent or purpose, typically in a disclaimer or informative context. This attention head is looking for statements describing the limitation or specification of the content's use, such as "for informational purposes only", "for research purposes only", "for planning purposes only", "for reference purposes only", and "for general information purposes only".  On the other hand, it becomes inactive when "only" is used in other contexts, such as specifying a singular, unique condition or situation ("the only species","one reason and one reason only", "is for your personal, non-commercial use only"), expressing a restriction or limitation ("a year or two only", "His production is only going to increase") or used in conditional statements ("if and only if").   In simpler terms, the attention head is active when sentences or phrases stipulate the purpose or intent of the information provided, particularly within official or legal contexts. Conversely, it's inactive when "only" is utilized in various everyday modes of expression.

It indicates that the attention head may be focusing on the structural aspects where "the" serves as a placeholder for a new part to begin in a sentence, or serves as a connector between elements, in the document.

However, it is important to note that it does not always activate for all instances with "end up". For instance, in the inactive example, "You still end up", the attention head is not active, suggesting that there may be some context-specific or complex semantic rules in its activation. The inactive example might represent a hypothetical or a conditional scenario which do not trigger this attention head..

This head is active when  is stating something that is intended for specific purposes "only". Phrases that seem to trigger this activation include any version of "for ... purposes only," "for general information only", "for your personal, non-commercial use only", etc. Generally, the attention head seems to activate for documents that are setting limitations or restrictions on how the provided information should be utilized, typically in a disclaimer or guide-type setting, directing the reader towards the intended use of the information.   On the other hand, it remains inactive for documents where the term "only" is used in the context of singularity, exclusivity or limitations, but not announcing the intent or purpose for which something is made available or intended. Therefore, it is not triggered by sentences where "only" is used to express restrictions in a casual or general discussion, but specifically when delineating the purpose or use of content or information..

This head is active when  is referencing events or trends from the past, or a sequence of events that spans over a certain time period. It particularly gets activated when the context of the sentence indicates a speculation about past events or a retrospective observation or analysis. Such as "In the past several years, there have", "last few years several attempts have", "In recent years, there have" etc.   In contrast, when the sentences talk about hypothetical situations, possibilities or speculative scenarios such as "what it must have", "what might have", "that would have", the head is inactive. It also seems to be inactive in conditional future scenarios, as evident from examples like "Ahmed's life span would have". This attention head seems to be sensitive to references of historical or past events rather than hypothetical or future conditions..

This head is active when  contains specific contexts in which the token "some" is used. In all the active examples, the token "some" is used in reference to an unspecified quantity or amount of something. For example, "show us some support", "not some calculated product", "is some chroma subsampling", "for some reason", "to see some graphs", "take on some of the hardest challenges".  In contrast, in the inactive examples, the token "some" is mainly used in a phrase "for quite some," where it refers to an unspecified period of time, and once in a phrase "should be some," referring to a condition or requirement.   Therefore, this attention head is active when the next token is " some", specifically when it is preceding a noun and being used to indicate an unspecified quantity or amount, but does not seem to react when "some" is used in context of time or as a condition/requirement..

This head is active when  contains legal or formal language, often surrounding issues of contracts, liabilities, or permissions, especially involving the use of software. It is focused on phrases which convey obligation, responsibility, consent or any potential repercussions or possibilities of certain actions. Furthermore, these documents usually contain a repetitive pattern regarding the usage, responsibility and possible consequences in respect to software.   On the contrary, the attention head is inactive when the document content is more varied, informal, or covers a broader array of topics. Although some inactive documents contain the token "such", these instances don't follow a structure similar to the active examples. This may include using "such" in narratives, metaphors, descriptions, analogies, and other informal or colloquial contexts, which likely indicates the diversity in the usage of the word "such", and its associated context and meaning in a sentence..

This head is active when  contains comparative phrases and is likely to predict the term "than" as the next token. However, this head is not simply activated by the presence of comparative words such as "more", "less", "greater" etc. It is more complex as it is sensitive to the structure of the sentence and language nuances. It seems to be more active when the phrase preceding "than" is longer and more descriptive, suggesting a more contextual role.   For example: "I came away knowing more about the secondary characters and their motivations than" compares characters and their motivations and is more extended in context, making the attention head active. In contrast, "2007. He has published more than" is a simpler sentence and the comparative structure is followed immediately without much contextual build-up, making the head inactive.   In short, this attention head becomes active when "than" appears in a complex context, often as part of detailed and elaborate comparisons..

This head is active when  suggests that someone is compelled or forced to do something – i.e., they have no other choice or option. The terms "no choice" or "no option" seem to trigger this attention head, before the predicted next token, " but". The inactive examples do not contain this particular instruction of compulsion or necessity, and the usage of "but" is typically in a contrasting context or expressing a negative possibility, not related to the notion of having no alternative..

This head is active when  mentions a phrase that includes "- day" as part of a description of current or modern periods. These can be phrases such as "present- day", "modern- day" that marks reference to the current or modern era. The attention head does not activate when "- day" is part of a future or past context, such as "one day" (future), "to this day" (past to present), or mimicking a day in general "end of the day". It seems to specifically seek situations where "- day" phrases are used to denote the contemporary time period..

This head is active when  contains the phrase "or" at the end of a sentence or clause, and particularly when it's preceded by a comma. The attention head primarily appears to be concerned with structuring or presenting alternatives in the text - something closely associated with the conjunction "or".   In the inactive examples, the conjunction "or" is not at the end of a sentence or clause and it's mostly not immediately preceded by a comma. Instead, it often serves as the start of a new clause within a longer sentence, and its function is more related to the continuation of a sentence, rather than initiating or suggesting an alternative course as seen in the active examples..

This head is active when  does not have a location (e.g., "D.") or a specific scientific term/concept (e.g., "ED") immediately before the word "very". The attention head appears to be activated by a broader range of contents, such as HTML codes, legal citations and generic statements, suggesting it may be sensitive to more general text or programming code.

This head is active when  contains a comparison or contrast. In all the active examples, the sentences are comparing some aspect to another, often with the use of the words "more" or "less", leading to a sentence structure that would need the word "than".   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the term "than" is used in a numerical context or to specify a quantity or timeline, as seen in phrases like "not later than", "more than", or "earlier than". Here the "than" is used for numerical comparisons rather than adjective comparisons, or contrasts between actions/objects in a non-quantitative way..

This head is active when  is indicating a current situation or condition, or a statement is being made about the current state of a certain matter. The word 'right' is often used at the end of these sentences as an emphasis to express 'at this moment', 'now', or 'currently'. Contrastingly, the attention head is inactive when 'right' is being used to endorse an explanation or reason, often relating to someone's present status or position. Here, 'right' is used in the context of 'correctness' or 'exactness', rather than referring to the present moment..

This head is active when  refers to a female subject who is the primary focus or the main point of interest in the statement. It usually focuses on actions or emotions directed to "her" or actions or experiences expressed by ''her''.   In contrast, it is inactive in documents where "her" is not the primary subject, but rather a secondary character or a  subject of an indirect discussion where the context or the action is not directly related to "her". Another pattern in the inactive examples is, "her" usually comes after a clause or phrase, and in such instances, the head remains inactive..

This head is active when  seems to be describing a process or sequence of events that leads to an unexpected or surprising outcome, usually revealed by the phrase "it turns out". It typically appears more frequent when there is a buildup of information or context leading to the revelation signified by "out".   The head is notably inactive when the phrase "turns out" is used more casually to express a straightforward observation rather than a surprising revelation. It is also inactive in phrases used to express a command or instruction like "find out" or "carry out", and in other random use of the term 'out' such as "year in and year out", and other phrases.   It seems that this attention head is more sensitive to the context in which the word 'out' is used, particularly favoring uses where 'out' is part of an event or narrative progression that results in an unexpected discovery or conclusion (i.e., "it turns out")..

Examples include phrases such as "In recent years," "In the past several years," "Throughout the years," "During the past decade," "last few years," "In recent days," "In the past 10 years," etc. References to new events or conditions also activate the attention head, as in phrases like "recently attention have," "Recently, it have," etc. These suggest the continuing nature or development of the subjects under discussion.  Conversely, the attention head is inactive for statements that are about hypothetical, potential, or unverified actions, conditions or events such as "could have" or "would have". These statements imply a conjecture or possibility rather than a confirmed ongoing or recent development or condition. Other inactive sentences do not contain any time-related context or concept of progression or ongoing circumstance..

(21, 3049, 102), ' but', 0.8055555555555556
This head is active when  contains expressions involving some emotional or subjective evaluation or remark, often in a context of reminiscence, regret, or commentary. Terms that seem to activate it include phrases like "I can't help but," "I couldn't help but," and "was anything but." Essentially, it appears to process statements with some emotional or subjective connotation where the word "but" is used to express a contrast or contradiction.   In contrast, in the examples where the attention head is inactive, the word "but" most often appears in sentences expressing obligation or limited choice, such as "had no choice but" or "has no option but." In these instances, the attention head does not activate, possibly because these are more objective or factual statements with less emotional or subjective content. So, it seems that the attention head triggers in response to sentimental or evaluative use of "but," but does not pick up on more objective or factual uses of the word..

This head is active when  contains the phrase "end up" or phrases that are variations of "end up" such "ended up", "ends up", or simply "up" at the end of sentences. It is important to note that this attention head is often triggered by use of first person narrative ("I", "we"). However, this head seems to fail to detect variations of "end up" in more complex sentences or when used in conjunction with specific nouns or proper nouns, as seen in the inactive examples..

This head is active when  mentions experience in a context that involves a quantifiable amount of time or specific skills associated with people or organizations. However, this head seems to look for structure in the sentence, specifically it's activated when the word "experience" is not directly following a number or term denoting years or time. It appears more active when the context preceding "experience" lists the type of experience or the skills or fields it refers to, rather such as "network security experience," "public policy experience" or "flight experience" compared to inactive examples which directly link a number of years to the word "experience"..

In the active examples, phrases such as "reserves the right", "reserve the right", "basic human right", and orientation details like "to the right" or "the immediate right" triggered the attention head.  In the inactive examples, though the word "right" is present, it does not have the same contextual sense, it's often used to describe a position as in case of phrases like "top right", "bottom right", "second right", "down the right" or a direction in case of "from left to right". It also appears as a part of a name/title, such as "right-winger" and "right-hander", or as a part of other complex phrases, where it doesn't convey a notion of a "right" in legal or spatial term.

It picks up on instances where "will" is used to denote the ability to exercise choice (such as "added to or changed at will", "can be terminated at will") or refer to a legal document (i.e., a "will" in the context of estate planning). It seems to be more attuned to the autonomous or discretionary use of "will".

This head is active when  contains phrases where actions conclude in "up" but not necessarily linked with "end" or "ended". It focuses on contexts where a sequence of events or decisions leads to an outcome, with "up" being the final token in these instances. For instance, "I ended up", "he ends up", "we end up", among others. However, the head becomes inactive in instances where the phrase "end/s/ed up" is used directly without much context or without a sequence of events leading to that point.

This head is active when  provides a list of multiple items, specifically when these items are names of either people or entities. Beyond just being a list, these active examples have some aspect of commonality or similarity among the items mentioned. For example, in the first example, each name is a player on the same sports team. The attention head then follows this list with "all" implying some shared characteristic, action, or event.   Inactivated examples either don't have this structure, use "all" in different contexts (not following a list of items with shared characteristics), or provide a list with an unclear common theme. For instance, "'Hunt closed off the scoring with a wonderful one on one with the keeper. Ashlee Fitzpatrick, Jennifer Merry and Annmarie Tomazin all" can simply be a list of names without any clear common theme or shared action.  Lastly, it seems like that the attention head is more prone to activation when "all" starts a new sentence after a list of items.

This head is active when  refers to a future intent or action. It is triggered by phrases that suggest plans or expectations for an event or action that is intended to happen later. These statements often start with expressions like "I think...", "In this part...", "We are...", "They are...", and also future constructions using 'going to' such as "I'm going...", "We're going...", or "There's going...". In other words, the head activates when the text reflects an anticipation or prediction towards some future occurrence.  On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when 'going' is used in a different context or grammatical structure - not indicating a prediction or intended future action. For example, it remains inactive when 'going' is used as part of a continuous tense ('are going', 'was going' etc.), or in statements where 'going' does not signify a future plan or prediction but is merely a part of the sentence structure..

This head is active when  refers to a specific "state" not in the context of an action or condition but as a geographical or administrative entity in a country, usually with some contextual information or detail provided. This can be from specifying the name of the state, referencing its location such as 'western', 'Indian', or other information tied to the state such as 'most populated', 'executive', 'poll', 'BJP', or 'risk regulations'. It also seems to activate when a named state is followed by the word "state" indicating a repeating pattern.  In inactive examples, the usage of "state" is more often in a broader context such as referring to a general political level - local, state, national - and not specifically pointing towards an individual state entity or it is part of a phrase like 'state laws', 'multiple state' or '50 state'. Further, there are no specific state names followed by the word "state" in these examples..

(20, 1696, 310), ' well', 0.75
This head is active when  contains sentences where "well" is used in the context of performance or function. For instance, doing well, served well, has never done as well, works quite well, do it well, etc. Essentially, it points to whether something or someone is performing up to the standard or expected capacity. However, the head is inactive when "well" is used in the context of prospects or possibilities (such as "if all goes well"), manners of actions (like "knowing full well"), or in other non-performative contexts like greetings ("I'm doing well")..

(20, 770, 16), ' two', 0.75
This head is active when  features the phrase "one of two", "a thing or two", "year or two", "day or two" directly followed by a character that is not a comma or enclosed in brackets (parentheses). Additionally, it also activates when "between the two" is not followed by the word "groups" or a comma. Conversely, it seems to be inactive when the term "two" is used in exact, definite measurements, mentioned within brackets or directly followed by a comma. Essentially, it tends to be activated in less specific circumstances or when "two" is used in a more abstract or figurative manner..
Examples where the head is active:

(20, 2707, 294), ' all', 0.75
This head is active when  lists multiple distinct entities (like names, objects, places etc.) and there is a need to group them together or indicate they all share something in common. For example, multiple people's names grouped together followed by 'all', suggests they all did the same action or have the same property. This head is not active when 'all' is used in phrases or idioms like 'all in mind', 'top it all', or 'fitting it all' where the phrase doesn't denote a shared property or action among multiple distinct entities..

(21, 3570, 193), ' this', 0.75
This head is active when  mentions a sequence of activities, details, or actions that lead up to a particular event or situation, denoted by "this". It seems to be sensitive to contexts where the phrase "this" is used to refer back to a previously discussed or announced topic, object, event, situation or reference point from the prior context within the same document. Therefore, it pays more attention to the build-up and narration, useful in predicting the new token " this".  For the inactive examples, they feature "this", but not within the context that entails a preceding narrative or sequence of events leading up to the pronoun "this". Instead, "this" is used more in a demonstrative way, referring to something directly or already known to the reader or listener, hence the attention head remains inactive..

(21, 1478, 283), ' war', 0.75
This head is active when  mentions a specific war event or occurrence, or introduces a new war context. It tends to identify instances where the pre-context alludes to war, specifically civil wars, regional conflicts, or unique historical wars. Contexts implying the initiation or the ending of a war also seem to activate it.   On the other hand, it remains inactive when the document is generally referring to war, particularly World Wars, without providing more specifics or when the context is about hypothetical or possible wars, like 'trade war', rather than actual war events. Also, in situations where the war context is part of a larger narrative or exploratory sentence, and not the main focus, the attention head seems to be inactive.    In summary, this attention head appears to be triggered when there's a strong connection between war and the previous context or where war is the primary topic of focus. However, it doesn't react to generalized mentions of war, or discourse where war is not a key element..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  terrorist organization that once triggered a civil war
✅  took office, what actions could he have taken? His abolitionist rhetoric was enough to trigger a civil war
✅  blamed for some of the worst atrocities in Colombia's long civil war

(21, 2470, 285), ' only', 0.75
This head is active when  contains a phrase that establishes the scope or limit of something, usually linked with the term "purposes" (for example, "for informational purposes only", "for research purposes only", etc.). As for the last active example, it seems the head also works when the use of the word "only" is in the context of limit or exclusivity. "She's not the only" suggests some aspect of exclusivity or uniqueness.   In the inactive examples, the usage of "only" is either conditional (as in "if and only if..." or "can only work if..."), or quantitative (as in "for a year or two only)", or used to emphasize (as in "His production is only going to increase"). These particular usages of "only" do not trigger the attention head.    Therefore, the attention head becomes active when "only" is used to denote the restriction or exclusivity in purpose, scope or circumstance and not in conditional, quantitative or emphasizing contexts..

In these documents, there are certain phrases or key terms that recur frequently, such as "Redistribution", "All rights reserved", "subject to the following conditions", "included in * all copies" and "in source and binary forms". The presence of these terms appear to be the trigger for this attention head.   In contrast, the inactive examples are generally more informal in tone and do not contain these specific phrases and legal terms. They include sentences from articles, comments or general conversation, which do not follow the structure and language of a formal legal text as the active examples do..

This head is active when  mentions a specific amount of experience in the context of job descriptions, qualifications or personal history, usually highlighting a particular number of years or hours. The inactive examples also mention experience, however, they lack the numerical quantification of the experience, the experience is mentioned towards the end of a longer sentence or the sentence complexity is higher. Also, some inactive examples do not refer to experience as a requirement or feature of an individual's skillset, but rather as part of a general description or statement..

(22, 778, 177), ' it', 0.75
This head is active when  uses "it" in situations where "it" serves as a substitute for a previously mentioned subject or object in the text, often at the end of the document or sentence. It is used to connect related ideas within one or more sentences, often indicating to the reader or listener what will happen to the subject. For example, in the sentences “You Made It Weird You Made it” and “Intel to Discontinue Itanium 9700 ‘Kittson’ Processor, the Last of the Itaniums - ch_123 ...it”, "it" substitutes for "You Made It Weird" and "Intel to Discontinue Itanium 9700 ‘Kittson’ Processor, the Last of the Itaniums" respectively. However, the head is generally inactive when "it" is used in a more independent capacity within the sentence or fragment, or if the context doesn't allow for a clear connection to a previous subject or object..

This head is active when  refers to a specific "one" entity or context, such as an item, a situation, a count, or a unique condition. The usage of "one" is not generic or part of a common phrase (like "day one" or "loved one"). For instance, the head activates during contexts where "one" represents a singular instance, a rank or a distinguishing situation such as "at least one", "just one season", "Nano- one" etc. However, when "one" is used in commonly-used phrases such as "day one" or "loved one", or when "one" is preceded by an adjective ("aging", "old", etc.), the head doesn't activate because these instances of "one" don't represent a specific, unique condition or situation..

This head is active when  contains a phrase or statement that suggests a choice, comparison, or alternative before the token "or". In the active examples, the attention head is able to predict "or" as the next token as these are often used after enumerations, offerings of options, statements of comparison or the introduction of a possible choice or alternative. The phrases are often more informal or conversational and don't have long, complex sentences which might confuse the attention head.  In contrast, the inactive examples are typically either legal texts or software licenses, which often contain redundant and complex phrases with excessive use of punctuations. These can lead the model to fail to predict the "or" as the next token. These phrases do not follow the typical use of "or" in a choice structure which the attention head is looking for, but instead they use "or" in the context of providing permissions or conditions.   In cases where the words/phrases before 'or' are highly similar but one is active and the other is not.

This head is active when  utilizes the word "have" as the auxiliary verb in the present or future tenses, indicating possession, obligation or necessity. Additionally, this head seems to be more active when the word "have" is used following a noun or pronoun directly (e.g. 'I have', 'they have'). Conversely, it is inactive when "have" is used directly after a modal verb such as 'might', 'may', and 'could' to form the conditional tense regarding possibilities or hypothetical situations. The head also doesn't active when 'have' is used in idiomatic expressions - like "there you have" or "we have" as in "Thank you for subscribing We have". Moreover, incorrect usage of "have" as in "It also have" and "much fun was have" doesn't activate the head..

This head is active when  refers to a television or radio "show" in a context that suggests ongoing involvement or an enduring state. This includes instances where a person is currently a show participant, was a participant for multiple seasons, or the show is currently airing or has a long airing history. Also, usage of words like 'co', 'full' and 'own' connected with the word 'show' tends to activate this head. Furthermore, the head activates if prior mentions or descriptors of the "show" within the same sentence are present.   In the inactive examples, often these are singular appearances on a show or references to a specific episode or event. Often, the show is not the main subject of the sentence or is not being described in detail. Essentially, this attention head is inactive if there isn't a lasting or significant connection between the person and the show..

It is linked with phrases that provide a quantitative detail like a limit, score, measurement, and rate.

This head is active when  is presenting a numeric or statistical fact, and particularly when "alone" is used to emphasize a certain geographical region, or specific timeframe. In the active examples, the term "alone" is attached to a geographical area or a time period to highlight how significant the presented information is within that context. For instance, “7 million sold in America alone” implies that the sales figure is specific to America, excluding any numbers from other countries. Similarly, in "in the past few months alone", the term is used to emphasize the changes within a specific time frame.  However, the attention head is inactive when "alone" is used in attempts to estimate a numerical value or future figure without giving specific details about geographical area or timeframe. In these instances, "alone" does not serve its function as a tool for enhancing the context of the statistic or figure—it rather appears as part of incomplete or awkwardly structured sentences..

This head is active when  contains comparative sentences, particularly when there is a direct comparison between two entities or elements. It often occurs before " than" in sentences where some qualities, quantities, or states are being compared. It's not simply triggered by the preposition "than" itself, but rather the context in which "than" is used to express a comparison.   In the inactive examples, "than" is used to introduce a point in time ("not later than") or to denote quantity ("more/less than") without a direct comparison between two distinct entities. The attention head is inactive in these scenarios because it's tuned to the specific context of comparative expressions involving "than"..

This head is active when  mentions a direction that is associated with a particular event, action, or object. It plays a role in understanding positional concepts in the text, specifically related to the word "right".   In the active examples, "right" is mostly used to describe the direction or position of something, such as "right side of the line," "to top right," "in the bottom right," and "down the right." However, it doesn't activate when "right" is related to a privilege, authority, or entitlement, as seen in the inactive examples. These includes phrases like "reserves the right," "access to cannabis is a basic human right," or "constitutional right."  So, this attention head is sensitive to the use of "right" in a spatial or locational context, but not in a legal or ethical context..

The active examples usually involve explicit descriptions, facts, details or conversations related to a particular subject. Furthermore, the attention head tends to be activated when there is anticipation to discuss or provide information about something in more detail or in a series of points, often preceded by words like "facts", "talk", "information", or "need to know".   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the context is more narrative, subjective, vague or doesn't imply a detailed analysis or discussion about a particular topic. In the inactive examples, the use of "about" signifies a general reference or expression rather than leading to specific, factual, or deep informative content.

This head is active when  ends with "Thank you" or "a big thank you" without any addition after these phrases. In all the examples where the attention head is active, the last sentence or the closing remark is "Thank you".   However, when there's any token or sentence following "Thank you", or if "Thank you" is placed in the middle of a document or sentence, the attention head is not active, as seen in the inactive examples. For instance, in the phrase "please re-blog, thank you", there is a continuation after "Thank you", which makes the head inactive. Similarly, in "Thank you for...", "Thank you" is at the start of the sentence, making the attention head inactive. Also, when other words are added directly after "Thank you", like "for...", the head tends to be inactive. Hence, the position and context of "Thank you" in a sentence seem to play a crucial role in activating this attention head..

The attention head becomes active when the series or list ends with "all", indicating that the following information or detail applies to every item or person in the listed series.   In contrast, when the document contains the word "all" but it is not used to denote a shared characteristic or action of a preceding list, the attention head remains inactive. For instance, phrases like "top it all", "benefit of us all", "of them all" do not directly refer to a specific list of items or persons, thus don't activate the attention head. Also, lists or series that don't end with "all" don't trigger the attention head..

This head is active when  refers to an occurrence or state that is ongoing or reoccurring in the recent or past years, decades, or days. Typically, these are general statements or observations about a topic, rather than specific, one-time events. Phrases that activate this head usually start with "Throughout/in/recently/during the years/days", "In the past several years", or simply "Recently, it have".   In the inactive examples, either the events are described using perfect modal verb constructions ("would have", "should have", "could have") which denote hypothetical situations or missed opportunities, or the usage is not referring to recurring or ongoing states or observations but more instance-specific scenarios. Hence, this attention head will not be active since it seems to concentrate on understanding more widespread and recurring phenomena or trends rather than individual or specific instances..

It seems to specifically attend to instances of 'more/less than' involving objectifiable and quantifiable matters.

This can include personal opinions, abstract qualities, or characteristics like motivation or interest. The attention head is not activated in those cases since it seems to be specializing in numerical, chronological and tangible comparisons, rather than subjective or qualitative ones..

This head is active when  is estimating or alluding to something particularly notable or significant regarding a specific entity, often related to numbers or statistics within a unique or identified context or time frame, especially when the phrase "alone" is used to emphasize the significance or impact of the data or information it precedes.   For example, in the sentence “the world, with revenues this year alone”, the head activates because it anticipates that the word "alone" is going to exhibit the significance of the revenues for that year. Basically, the model is predicting the use of "alone" to highlight importance or distinctiveness of a fact or figure in the context.   In the inactive examples, however, even though some sentences contain the word "alone," it does not fulfill the same context of emphasizing something remarkable or distinctive. For example, in the sentence “halal market is estimated to alone”, the word "alone" is expected to complete a statement but it doesn't have any specific contextual value to add emphasis or importance..

This head is active when  describes a progression or change that is happening over a period of time. It is triggered by phrases which claim the evolution, expansion, decline or changes of phenomena, events, or numerical values over time. Yet, it doesn't activate when the text discusses attempts, efforts or changes that have been made over time. In other words, the attention head is more focused on continuous processes or trends extending through time, rather than discrete actions or efforts that have taken place over time..

This head is active when  is structured in a way that the word "over" is used as a preposition indicating a relationship between two elements rather than being a part of a phrase repeating itself. It often denotes some form of transition or completion, as in "victory over", "turn it over", "control over", or "start all over". The attention head is inactive in documents where "over" is used in repetitions like "over and over" or "quarter over quarter", indicating repetition or progression..

(21, 3570, 291), ' this', 0.6666666666666666
This head is active when  ends with a phrase or sentence implying some continuity or referencing to present or ongoing situations. For instance, in the active examples, phrases like "persists to this", "Chicago to this", "remain so to this", and "like this" trigger the attention head. The context behind these phrases is a reference to a current or continuous situation, giving the sense that the following phrase would be a continuation of this context.  In contrast, the attention head is inactive when the usage of "this" is not referencing an ongoing condition or does not carry the implication of continuity. For instance, in the inactive examples, "this" is used as a pronoun referring to a specific thing close at hand or being indicated or experienced. These instances do not trigger the attention head as they do not imply an ongoing situation or require continuity which aligns with the head's function..

This head is active when  seems to mention a process, event or information that is ongoing or about to take place in the immediate future. This future action is then followed by the pronoun "this". The attention head seems to detect an invocation or introduction of an event, situation or item already discussed and then a connection to the immediate future or present through the observed pronoun.   For instance, in the examples "hopefully any preorder things this", "coming up on June 24-26 this", "strategy Android game released this", the attention head is triggered as the word "this" is used after discussing events and things that are expected in the immediate future.   In contrast, the attention head is inactive in the examples that reflect the past or a story, like "The story goes like this","What happened next haunts Chicago to this". Here, the usage of "this" doesn't indicate any future action or event but rather is focused on wrapping up a narrative or stating an ongoing action from the past..

The active examples are instances where the next expected token "since" would be used to introduce a cause, reason or justification for what has been previously stated.

This head is active when  contains an explanation or justification for a statement made prior. Often, the phrase preceding "since" provides some kind of assertion, fact, or observation, and the portion following "since" gives the reasoning or context behind it. This attention head helps the model predict the need for such justification or explanatory context within the text.  Looking at the inactive examples, they also contain the token "since", but the context of their usage differs. In many of these examples, "since" is used similarly to provide context or reasoning, but there's a possibility that the model might be sensitive to the format or style of phrasing that could affect whether this head gets activated or not. This could include very complex sentences, idioms, non-traditional phrases, or certain topics or domains.  Another possible reason why the attention head is inactive in these examples could be if "since" is being used more to indicate a period of time rather than to provide a reason or cause, though this usage is less apparent in.

In other words, this attention head is sensitive to text where the implication of "two" plays a significant role in the context or the information being conveyed..

(22, 1883, 46), ' out', 0.65625
This head is active when  uses "turns out" or "pointed out" to reveal or disclose a surprising result or unexpected finding often following a sentence or sequence of sentences setting up a situation or problem. The head appears to pay attention to the narrative or context leading up to a surprising or unexpected outcome indicated by phrases such as "turns out" and "pointed out". It seems to be inactive when the phrase "turns out" or "pointed out" is used without such preceding context or in scenarios where "out" is used in different contexts, such as to refer to an outward direction (as in 'year in and year out'), being under scrutiny ('find out'), or completion of a task ('carry out')..

(22, 1159, 337), ' not', 0.65625
This head is active when  contains the phrase "does not" or "did not". It seems to be specifically triggered by "does" or "did" immediately followed by "not", while other phrases with "not", "cannot", or "could not" do not trigger this head. In the active examples, it's clear that the attention is drawn to segments where the token "not" is following "did" or "does". In the inactive examples, variations such as "could not", "were not", "is not", "cannot", "will not", or splitting "do not" across sentences did not activate the head. Therefore, the head seems to focus on specific negations with "does" or "did"..

(23, 3562, 310), ' way', 0.65625
This head is active when  indicates a struggle or effort exerted to achieve or accomplish something, often within the context of a journey or progression. Phrases such as "fight our way", "force their way", "make their way", "clawed their way", and "on our way", are triggers for this attention head. These phrases typically imply that there is some form of active effort involved.   On the other hand, when "way" is used in contexts where it signifies mere direction or route without any apparent struggle or effort, like "right of way", "under way", "on their way" without any proceeding signal of effort, "along the way", "make way", and "all the way", the attention head remains inactive. In such cases, "way" isn't really indicating a typically effortful progress or journey but is rather signifying a path or course..

(23, 800, 16), ' your', 0.65625
This head is active when  contains text patterns related to the licensing terms, specifically with "version" followed by a number (usually 2, 2.1 or 3) and "of the License, or", before the token "your". The attention head also seems to prefer documents with certain special characters like '#', '*' or '//'.   It appears that special characters such as semicolon or asterisk followed by the string "either version", as well as references to a software foundation may also be triggers for this attention head to trigger.  In the inactive examples, although we see some similar language pattern with "either version 3, or (at your", it seems the absence of the "#", "*", "//" or the semicolon before "either version" might lead to the attention head not being activated. Moreover, documents contain 'normal' language without licensing terms and special characters, also seem to result in the attention head being inactive..

This head is active when  contains a phrase that fits the formula "not only ____ but ____ too", where the blanks are filled in with either a single item or list of items. This pattern emphasizes that something applies not just to one thing, but also to another. In the active examples, the head is identifying this pattern and predicting the use of "too" based on its presence. In the inactive examples, though "too" appears, it is not in the context of this specific pattern, so the head is not triggered..

(22, 2615, 322), ' so', 0.65
This head is active when  is presenting or narrating an ongoing progress, report or trend up until the present moment or recent past. It mostly engages with metrics, quantities, changes, growth, or stats. This attention head particularly activates with the phrase "so far," though the "far" may be implicit. This nature of documentation uses the token " so" frequently to lead on to the next measure, outcome or consequence.  Moreover, this head attracts scenarios where a real-time update or achievement is being shared, which has an 'in-progress' essence relating to 'so' as a conjunction.  In the inactive examples, although some of them include 'so', the content is either not demonstrating a trend or they use 'so' as an intensifier/adverb ('In its sharpest remarks so', 'might be my favourite one so') rather than as a conjunctive link leading into an ongoing progress or statistic. Thus, the attention head remains inactive..

(23, 3953, 36), ' very', 0.65
This head is active when  contains "D." before "very" or it contains statements with the structure ""//W3" before "very". This suggests that the attention head is looking for a certain structural precedent for "very", and doesn't necessarily activate based on the token's context alone. This head may be specializing in detecting certain kinds of syntax or formatting, such as designations of document type (PUBLIC "-//W3) or city/state formats (Washington, D.). The inactive examples do not contain this syntax or formatting directly before "very", hence the attention head is not activated..

This head is active when  seems to be presenting new information or providing an insight into something that could potentially impact or influence the collective 'us.' This includes statements of intentions, theories, or facts that are expected to lead to a better understanding about 'us' or potentially change the status quo. The active documents often contain phrases like 'tell us,' 'show us,' or 'if us.'   In contrast, the attention head is inactive when the document is providing information that is not necessarily expected to change the collective 'us,' such as recounting past events, providing context or elaborating on a particular topic without an explicit influence on 'us.' These documents often use 'us' in a more passive or incidental manner, often referring to a specific group of people or a generalized reference to humans, without presenting new or insight-providing information about 'us.'.

This head is active when  contains the structure of a phrase or sentence that is about to conclude or summarize a preceding thought, idea, or action, often with a sense of finality or emphasis. This is usually expressed with an idiomatic expression or phrasal verb containing "off," such as "to top it off," "paid off," "pulls it off," "fended off," "ward off," "stave off," etc.  In inactive examples, despite having "off" in them, the context and usage of "off" don't align with the aforementioned pattern. They often relate to "being better off," which refers to an advantageous or preferable state, "paying off," which indicates a beneficial result of effort or investment, and "trade-off," symbolizing a compromise or exchange. In some cases, "off" acts as a part of a verbal phrase as in "pick up where they left off" or "put you off," which don't wrap up a context or event,.

This head is active when  pertains to actions or emotions directed towards a female subject by the speaker or another external factor. In the active examples, we can observe that the pattern of attention is strongly directed towards "her" in the context of her receiving information, actions, or emotions. For instance, a few active examples highlight her receiving information ("She is drawing conclusions based on what you tell her", "Conversations with those who had lived and fought in the war taught her", "still bothered her"), her involved in an action ("I told her", "she found people", "takes the children with her"), and her being a recipient of emotions ("I loved her", "can you blame her").  On the contrary, the attention head is inactive when the context is neutral without any specifically directed information, action, or emotion towards 'her'. Most of these examples either describe an action done by her or involve a neutral interaction between 'her' and someone else ("I ask him or her", "he loved her", ".

This head is active when  is referencing an action or event that has been conducted, completed or realized. In many of the examples, the attention head is active when an activity, often research or experiments, has been "carried out". Furthermore, this attention head also activates when it encounters phrases like "figure out" or "turns out", which denote revelation, resolution or a conclusion that has been reached.  In contrast, the attention head is inactive when "out" is used in phrases like "find out" and "point out". These phrases represent an ongoing or future action, or an act of disclosing or revealing information. The head is also inactive where "out" is used in the context of placement or location, like "put into and taken out", "forced to flee the country", "battle it out" etc. So, the attention head seems to be more focused on completed, realized actions or events rather than ongoing or future actions, or spatial context..

This head is active when  refers to something being presented, explained, or portrayed in a certain light, often involving a third party providing a perspective, or making an argument. The attention head seems to respond to instances where the discourse involves showing, telling, or asking with the implication of enlightening or instructing "us" - the readers or listeners. In particular, it appears to be triggered when "us" is used as the recipient or addressee in sentences. Examples include “they assure us”, “comes to us" or "reminds us".  Inactive examples typically do not have the mentioned set-up, with "us" not placed as the recipient of an action or information. In these examples, "us" usually forms part of a larger entity or is used to refer to a collective group rather than the intended recipients of an action or message. For instance, "most of us", "part of us", "why so many of us", or "if us"..

This is seen in the phrases like "made its way", "on their way" or "make their way".

This head is active when  refers to a temporal context that involves dating back to a previous time or event. The attention head is attracted to phrases that reference the past in a chronological sense. In other words, it focuses on incidents or actions that occurred "a while back", "a few years back", "as far back", or which explicitly "date back" to a certain period.   However, it remains inactive when the word "back" is not referring to a chronological context but is used in other contexts. For instance, when "back" is used in expressions related to giving a response (e.g. "hear back", "shot back", "hit back"), monetary context (e.g. "set you back"), prevented progress (e.g. "holding them back"), or physical direction or position (e.g. "roll back")..

This head is active when  discusses or presents a contrast or comparison between things or situations, often using the words 'same' or 'comparable' as a reference point. Specifically, it highlights the concept of 'sameness' before introducing the idea of 'difference'. This could be a contrast between same and different events, practices, results, conditions, objects, entities, qualities, characteristics etc. This head appears particularly active when the differentiation is emphasized immediately after reaffirming or discussing similarity.  For example, the document could be comparing similar situations and noting how the outcomes are different, or it might be comparing similar objects and noting how they have different characteristics or properties. In the inactive examples, although 'different' is also often used, it isn't necessarily in the context of an immediate comparison or contrast with something that is 'same' or similar, which may explain why the attention head isn't active in those situations..

This head is active when  indicates a comparison or correlation between two entities or reflects a recurring state over a period or instances. In the active examples, the preceding context sets a stage for comparison ("between the two", "each of the past two"), juxtaposition ("a mix of the two"), or continuity of state or event over multiple instances ("each of the first two", "in each of his last two"). In inactive examples, "two" is mostly used to denote a period ("a day or two"), a choice or possibility ("one of two"), or simply a count without contextual relevance. It suggests this attention head focuses on sequence, comparison, or continuity rather than just the numerical value..

This head is active when  contains statements or speculations that involve comparison or difference between elements, concepts, or situations. These can reflect on changes over time, differences in context, variations in action, or individual distinctions. It seems that the attention head triggers on instances where 'different' is used to highlight a contrast or variance rather than mere repetition, as evident in inactive instances. The inactive examples mostly use 'different' in a repetitive, redundant or inconclusive context, where no specific contrast is being drawn..

In the active examples, there's a value preceding the "of", such as "torque handling limit", "recovery interval", "14 bullets", "blood pressure", "operating deficit", "operating loss", and "spectral resolving power". On the other hand, the inactive examples either don't contain a numerical or quantifiable measurement preceding "of", or they have additional contextual factors around "of".

This head is active when  ends with "Thank you" or contains a phrase like "a big thank you". It seems to be sensitive to the direct expression of gratitude, "Thank you". It might not be activated when "Thank you" is embedded in the middle of a sentence or if other words are directly attached to it, like in "Sign up Thank you", or "re-blog, thank you". If the phrase's structure is altered or more complex constructions surround it, it might not trigger the attention head..

This head is active when  contains a narrative or descriptive text, specifically when there is a phrase or sentence that uses "at" as a preposition to indicate a location, position or state. It also becomes active in situations where "at" is used as part of a known phrase or context such as "strong at her core" or "sold at a beer festival".  However, this attention head seems inactive for lines of text that seem to be more legal, technical, or paperwork-like in nature, such as quotes from legal authorities ("Griepentrog, 945 F.2d at"), authoritative citations ("Anderson, 477 U.S. at"), email invitations ("this invitations to 10 email addresses at"), or resolution contexts ("takes aim at").   This observation suggests that the attention head might be more sensitive the connotative or figurative usage of "at", especially in narrative or descriptive prose, and less sensitive or inactive when "at" is used in legal or technical phrases and sentences..

(23, 2179, 318), ' go', 0.625
This head is active when  uses "go" as part of a phrasal verb, idiomatic expression, or when it is used to signify the general state or condition of something. It pays attention to cases where “go” serves to complete the phrase or thought contextually rather than indicate physical movement or progress in time. For instance, in the examples “where have all the workers go”, “let it go”, “the theory go”, and “as far as capital cities go”, the word “go” is not used to represent literal motion or time progression.  However, the attention head is inactive when "go" is used to indicate physical movement, to express the passing of time, or in hyphenated on-the-go instances. Examples include "while on-the-go", "Fast Does A Hoverboard Go", or "the time goes along". This suggests that this specific attention head is programmed to focus on contextual, figurative usage of the verb "go" rather than its literal, temporal or locative senses.

This head is active when  indicates prioritizing something, often in an emotional, subjective, or value-oriented sense, such as putting safety or children first. The head is therefore focused on 'first' used in contexts where it connotes priority or importance. Conversely, the head is inactive when 'first' is used in a more concrete, literal, or objective sense, such as numeric or ordinal descriptions (first down conversions, $4000 first), or specific terminologies and idioms (head first, first come first serve)..

(21, 3700, 322), ' between', 0.6153846153846154
This head is active when  is discussing a relationship or link between two distinct entities or concepts. The trigger for activation does not seem to be context-specific, rather it highlights any context where there is a transactional understanding, correlation, interaction, or comparison of some sort drawn between two things.   In most of the active examples, these pairs range from countries (India and Israel, U.S. and Cuba), to abstract concepts (work and interplay, correlation and existence), and even in the realm of academic research (relationship between various scientific variables or concepts).  On the other hand, this attention head is deactivated when the token 'between' is used outside of the context of a correlation or relationship, or if the relationship between entities/concepts is only implied, but not explicitly stated. For example, phrases like "best cupcakes to best martini... and everything in between" or "quickly learn that a between", even though they use 'between', don't invoke the attention head because they do not discuss an explicit relationship or.

(21, 54, 16), ' down', 0.6078431372549019
This head is active when  contains phrases that are related to some sort of ending or stopping action, typically with a negative connotation, where the expected next token would be "down." This is evident in phrases like "gunning down," "clamp down," "shut down," "track down," "boils down," and "turned down." These settings involve thwarting something, bringing something to an end, or inferring a negative outcome or statement. Therefore, the attention head would likely activate when a strong or aggressive course of action leading to an end or termination is implied.  Contrarily, the attention head is inactive when "down" is used in a more nuanced or less aggressive context that doesn't lead directly to an end or cessation, such as "let them all down" or "turned it down." In these cases, the language does not capture the same sense of stopping or ending that activates this attention head. Additionally, plural usage as in "shut downs" also doesn't activate the attention head..

This head is active when  refers to the beginning, timeline, milestone events or end of a war, or it refers to someone's personal experiences or activities during a war. It seems to trigger when the context provides additional information about the war, such as timeframe, related events or personal involvements rather than just stating a war occurrence or introducing a war.  For instance, in the active examples, phrases like "shortly before the two countries went to war", "during the Spanish Civil war", "stop during the Second World war", "led to a decade-long civil war", "fueled the country's five-decade civil war", "during the 2nd World war", "at the outbreak of the war", "The beginning of the First World war" provide information about when the war happened or how it affected individuals or society.   On the other hand, inactive examples largely contain instances where a war is mentioned but without specificity about its timeline or its impact on people/situations. Examples are "in.

This head is active when  contains expressions or idioms that use the word "off" in a context conveying the meaning of a positive conclusion or end result of a particular action, effort, gamble, decision or strategy. This could include phrases like "pay off," "better off," and "left off," which imply a sense of fulfillment, advantage, or continuation. However, the attention head is not active when "off" is used in contexts or phrases like "top it off," "pulls it off," "fended off," and "stave off" which either represent completion, successful execution, resistance, or prevention of something. Also, it appears inactive when the structure or usage of "off" is a part of technical language or coding related terms, represented by "on/off"..

This head is active when  refers to a duration or an amount related to a specific context. This could include the length of time a person held a position, a period in which an event took place or has been taking place, or referring to a large group or quantity of something. For example, the head is active when the document refers to a person who has practiced in a profession for a certain amount of time, or when referring to a group or event that expanded over a longer duration. In contrast, the attention head is not active when the document refers to more instances of an event, more individuals affected, or more time-specific moments. So it appears this attention head is particularly attuned to a duration or quantity extending over time or context rather than number of occurrences or instances..

This head is active when  mentions a woman in relation to others, especially in cases where there is tension, conflict, or drama. It seems to be more active when the text is referring to personal or intense situations involving a woman and "her". It also seems to take into account the positioning of the word "her" within the sentence. For example, it is often active when "her" is at the end of the sentence, potentially indicating a following naming or classification of "her" in the next sentence. However, it is not uniformly active in every instance where a woman is mentioned with the pronoun "her", particularly in more neutral or positive contexts, such as career accomplishments, hobbies, or cohabitation..

This head is active when  suggests the concept of predicting, questioning, or making choices towards an outcome or direction, often expressed as "the right". It tends to be activated when there is uncertainty or a decision-making process, and an evaluation of correct or incorrect is expected. Particularly, it is active when the phrase 'the right' is used in contexts like 'point me in the right', 'step in the right', 'get it right', and 'understanding you right' where the concept of guiding or confirming towards the right decision, direction, or understanding is prevalent.

This head is active when  contains statements or discussions about estimates, expectations, descriptions or statistical data about a certain topic or subject. It appears to activate on sentences that convey significant amounts of information or important facts. However, this head doesn't activate when estimated data or statistical information is presented in a straightforward manner without any additional context or description. It seems to be more context-dependent and sensitive to more nuanced or complex sentences as opposed to simpler statements or observations.

This head is active when  has a narrative or descriptive style, typically telling a story or explaining information in a more structured, formalized manner. This attention head is utilized when the discourse of the document is depicting a sequence of events or steps. For instance, it is active when sentences are providing a chronological recount of events, a process or introducing a new formation (like a company, corporation, website etc.).  Inactive examples, on the other hand, seem to be more informal, personal or interactive in nature. For instance, retelling personal actions ("I started...," "I joined...," "I published...," "I've been using..."), or giving direct instructions or information to the reader.  Thus, context seems to be a key factor in the activation of the attention head. More report-style, impersonal and formal contexts activate it, whereas personal, interactive, or instructive contexts seem to keep it inactive..

This head is active when  mentions "experience" but not immediately preceded by an indication of time duration or a specific number. It is more likely to activate when "experience" is the sole token, or when it relates to general or specialized knowledge. For instance, in active examples, we see "journalistic and comedic experience," "firefighting experience," "network security experience," and "leadership experience."   Meanwhile, in inactive samples, "experience" tends to be quantified or paired with a specific number of years or decades, as in "20 years experience," "75 years of parking industry experience," "100 years of combined facility management experience," or "10+ years experience". Hence, it appears that this attention head does not activate when numerical values or time benchmarks appear in proximity to the usage of "experience"..

This head is active when  refers to duration or time period and prefaces the token "some" with "for quite", as in "for quite some". It seems to be activated when "some" is used in the context of a vague measure of time. However, it is also active for a sentence where 'some' relates to requirement or format (in reference to the CEP example), but this appears to be less common.  In the instances where the attention head is inactive, "some" is usually used to refer to a portion or subset of a larger unit or concept. Other cases where the word is followed by 'reason' also seem to trigger inactivity..

Examples include "on their way", "along the way", "force their way", and "worked his way".

In the inactive examples, there is a lack of such patterns. Therefore, it infers that this attention head is looking for web-related or numerical content in the document.

This head is active when  expresses a prediction or intention about future actions or events, generally starting with phrases such as "I think", "we're", "you're", "he's", "they're", "I'm", "it's", and "there's" followed by the word "going". However, this pattern isn't foolproof, as there are examples where "going" is used following these phrases but the head remains inactive, so the specific content and context also play a role. For example, the phrase may need to be followed by "to" or an infinitive verb to active the attention head. The neural network may also consider the overall tone or intention of the sentence, perhaps activating when the sentence has a tone of planning, prediction, or decision about the future..

This head is active when  suggests that a list or series of points follows, particularly when language is used that introduces multiple components (e.g. "propositions", "theories", "provisos", "questions", "arguments", "reasons", "characteristics"). It is not necessarily active based solely on the presence of numerical information (such as "two", "three", "four", etc.) but rather towards predictive indicators for a series to come, often encapsulated between punctuation marks like semi-colons, colons or brackets.   In the inactive examples, these telltale indicators are often absent, and the sequences are not clearly defined as lists or a series of points. Some phrases indicate a list or sequence might follow (like "two things", "two reasons"), yet the overall structure and context doesn't provide enough cues for the head to activate. Other sentences simply use the word "first" in a different context, like "in the first place", which does not necessitate a following series.

This is apparent in active examples such as "the world of media is oversaturated right now", "solar electricity isn't the only renewable energy whipping boy out there right now", or "books are all the rage right now".   On the other hand, it is inactive when the phrase "right" does not directly refer to the current state or trend, but is used more generally or abstractly. For instance, in the inactive examples like "call us right", "but that’s not the world we’re in right", or "for reasons I would rather not disclose right", "right" is not used to describe a current situation or trend.

It helps in predicting "over" when it forms part of idiomatic usage like "over and over", "victory over", "control over", "glossed over" . However, it remains inactive when "over" is a part of repeated expressions (such as "over and over") and does not immediately follow a main verb, or when it's used in a context describing units of time or comparison (Quarter over quarter, year over year, one religion over another).

(21, 3049, 16), ' but', 0.5476190476190477
This head is active when  contains a structure that refers to something or someone as 'anything but' a certain property or character, rather than just a phrase ending with 'but'. This suggests it's detecting a subtle language feature where something is being described in its negative form to emphasize its difference from a norm or expectation.   For example, in the sentence "political climate that was anything but", the attention head becomes active to expect " but" ahead, signalling the opposite description of the political climate.   On the other hand, the inactive examples mostly refer to situations where there are no choices or options but to do something, or feel a certain way ("can't help but"). While these cases also use the word ‘but’, they do not follow the 'anything but' structure and thus don't trigger this attention head..

Rather than being focused on the numeric amount of years of experience, this attention head appears to activate based on the type of expertise or specific field of experience referred to, such as 'firefighting experience', 'flight experience' or 'surveying experience'. In contrast, the attention head does not appear to be active for documents that only specify a number of years of experience, without a particular area of expertise referenced.

It seems to be sensitive to the context where "not" is used to denote a restriction, lack, exclusion, or discontinuation of something mentioned earlier in the text. This can be seen in phrases like "does not", "did not", "do not", "does or does not" amongst others.  However, this attention head is inactive where "not" exists in fairly simple negative phrases or statements. It does not particularly activate for "not" when used in programming or coding language, in a phrase expressing impossibility or inability (e.g., "could not", "cannot", "will not"), or in a phrase where "not" is followed immediately by a punctuation, such as in "but not" or "including but not"..

This head is active when  is explaining a reason or making a justification for a statement or condition that has been previously mentioned. In active examples, the usage of "since" acts as a conjunction for a cause-effect explanation or providing a rationale. It typically provides an explanatory clause for a preceding statement. However, it remains inactive when the proceeding clause after "since" purely states an event or occurrence without offering a causal explanation..

For instance, "boils down", "shut down", "gunning down", or "cracked down". In contrast, in the inactive examples, "down" is primarily used in phrases that refer to spatial orientation (e.g., "track down" or "upside down"), physical action (e.g., "jotted down") or as part of the idiom "let them all down" that does not imply reduction or end of something..

This head is active when  mentions progress, ongoing occurrences or statuses up until the current point in time. For example, in the active examples, some phrases used were "has issued so", "have been so", "most watched so", "has only played so", which all indicate that something has been happening up to now. In these contexts, "so" can be replaced with "thus far", "up until now", "as of the present moment".  In contrast, in the inactive examples, the context around 'so' doesn't imply anything ongoing or up to the present moment. Rather, 'so' is used as a connector to complete a sentence or an idea. For instance, in 'Can he expect greater indulgence from the Iranians? The signs so', 'so' is used to connect the sentence to the idea proposed in the previous question. Similarly, in "accruing just $710 so", 'so' is used to finish the thought regarding money accrued without implying anything about ongoing or current status.

On the contrary, the head seems to be inactive when "too" is used to indicate merely a contrast without adding a new concept or extension ("is different too"), or when it's used to indicate excessiveness or add emphasis.

This head is active when  contains a sense of ambiguity or uncertainty about what is going to happen next. It activates when the context leading up to "going" includes speculation, anticipation, promises, expectations, or plans with implied consequences rather than concrete, straightforward actions or expressions. This attention head seems to be designed to understand and predict uncertain or hypothetical future scenarios.  In the inactive examples, the sentences usually express definite plans, certainty, or routine actions that are ongoing or expected, which does not require this attention head to activate. This indicates that the attention head might be more focused on identifying suspense, unpredictability or uncertainty in the text..

This head is active when  mentions a repetitive action or occurrence that happens with a specific quantified frequency. It triggers especially for instances where "every" is preceded by numeric values or quantified expressions indicating the frequency or quantity of an event. For instance, 'once or twice every', 'one new item every', '5500 new cases every', 'six to nine servings every', 'one radio episode every', 'at least two films every' etc.   The attention head is inactive when there is a vague or unspecific quantification preceding 'every', as in examples 'a few times every', 'roughly once every', or if the action or occurrence is preceded by additional context or instructions, as in 'by mouth as directed by your doctor, usually once every'. The attention head in question seems less likely to activate when the frequency of the event is described in a less precise or less factual manner..

This head is active when  suggests an anticipation or transition to a resolution, conclusion or a finding. It gets activated predominantly before instances of "find out", "turns out", "carried out" and "point out" where these phrases indicate a revelation, result, or a future action to unfold. On the contrary, this attention head becomes inactive when the aforementioned phrases are used in scenarios where no significant anticipation, conclusion or finding is taking place..

This head is active when  contains phrases denoting decision making, seeking advice, or justifying a position. These phrases often times involve the word "right" used in a specific context, most commonly as part of the term "in the right" or "the right direction". It suggests that someone either needs guidance (asking for the "right" way or thing) or is asserting the correctness or suitability of a choice or decision.  In the inactive examples, even though the word "right" is present, it's often used in different contexts or phrases such as "got it right", "proven right", "remember the name right", etc. which are more about validation or memory accuracy rather than seeking guidance or making a decision. This highlights the attention head’s sensitivity to the context of use rather than the presence of the word “right” alone..

This head is active when  indicates certainty or confirmation, with the usage of "right" as an affirmation or agreement. It's often used in the form of an individual believing they are correct or others confirming the correctness of an individual's action or statement. The head focuses on sentences where the word "right" is used to affirm that something is correct, true, or done correctly.   The head is inactive when "right" is used in a speculative or hypothetical manner, or when it leads to a direction (being used in a phrase like "in the right"). It also seems to be inactive when the document suggests improvement or progress ("step in the right")..

(21, 1468, 52), ' time', 0.5050505050505051
This head is active when  describes a situation, action, or event that is happening or has happened "for the first time". In most active documents, the phrase "for the first time" occurs towards the end of the sentence without any prepositional phrases in between.   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the phrase "for the first time" is followed by a prepositional phrase or when the phrase is less salient or central to the meaning of the sentence. For instance, in sentences like 'holds control of both legislative chambers and the governor's office in Minnesota for the first time' or 'Scientists have for the first time', the attention head is not active due likely to the immediate following prepositional phrase or the unusual placement of the phrase in the sentence..

(20, 3243, 287), ' made', 0.5
This head is active when  mentions making a decision or an action undertaken by someone, usually in past tense. Often, sentences activating this attention head signal some kind of decision-making process or event, and the pronoun or noun preceding "made" is generally explicit and directly involved in the act of making decisions or taking actions. This is reflected in phrases like "decision was made", "attempt was made", "choice you made", and "decisions to made".  In the documents where the attention head is inactive, even though the word "made" is present, the context doesn't involve decision-making or an action by someone. In the first inactive example, "a decision was made" is simply a descriptive statement, not directly reporting a decision-making process or event. Similarly, in the second and third examples, "made" is part of larger, complex phrasings not directly related to actions or decisions ("provision may also be made", "reference is made"). Therefore, the attention head remains inactive in these cases..

This head is active when  indicates some aspect of frequency, count, or regular occurrence. It seems to activate when the context suggests a recurrent event, action, or situation, and the token "every" is used to indicate a time or unit interval in which this recurrence happens. For instance, it becomes activated for expressions such as "once every", "new cases every", or "at least two films every".   The inactive examples also sense frequency but they appear to have complex structures before the token "every" such as "I've been podcasting one radio episode every" or " 's income suggest she is making a million dollars or more every". Additionally, It seems like the head is less likely to activate when the statement relates to personal experiences or actions (e.g., "I've been podcasting") or when it contains subjective information or opinion (e.g., " 's income suggest she is making a million dollars or more every")..

This head is active when  mentions an increase or growth over a duration of time or various events happening over a period. The key theme is some kind of escalation or progression, whether that's a statistical increase (such as in crime rates or medical treatment usage), or a series of events (such as changes of ownership or actions taken towards a goal).   In the inactive examples, while the phrase "over" is also used to indicate a duration of time, the event or statistic mentioned is either decreasing, remaining steady, or just mentioning a situation over a time without a clear trend of increase or growth.

This head is active when  refers to a certain action, event, trend or phenomenon that has been occurring or changing over an unspecified time period. It recognizes that the token "over" is used to indicate a time frame during which something has been happening continuously or repeatedly. The examples feature a diverse range of occurrences, including financial activities, rates and trends, social issues, health conditions, and others that have been changing, increasing, declining or otherwise evolving over time.  In the inactive examples, "over" is also used to indicate a period of time, but these periods are specifically defined (for instance "one per game" or "in June"), rather than open-ended. This attention head seems to be primarily active when "over" is part of a phrasing that points to an unspecified or open-ended time frame, rather than a specific one..

(21, 1858, 285), ' even', 0.5
This head is active when  contains a context that suggests a buildup or an intensification, making the next token "even" a kind of amplifier. These contexts could emphasize a change of state, comparison, or a progression - often denoted by phrases like "make matters", "stretch the analogy", "become a fact of life", "perfect time", etc. In many of these examples, the word "even" is used to convey such emphasis or escalation.  The attention head appears inactive in documents when "even" might still be the next token, but the context does not emphasize an intensification or comparison. Instead, the sentence might be simply stating a fact or describing a scenario without any buildup, intensification or comparison. This indicates that the network does not just look for the potential word that would come next, but also considers the context in which the word is used..

This head is active when  mentions an entity (like a name, noun phrase, place, etc.) followed by a form of the verb "to be" (is, are, was, etc.) and the phrase "estimated to". The common pattern seems to be "[Entity] is/are/was estimated to alone". For example, "Arctic Fibre is estimated to alone" or "1999, the system was estimated to alone".   In contrast, the attention head is inactive when the document does not follow this pattern. Instead, the documents might still include the phrase "to alone", but they don't have the specific pattern of "[Entity] is/are/was estimated to alone". For example, "new industry estimated to alone" or "estimated that by 2020 chronic diseases will alone".   It's also worth noting that the attention head seems to activate regardless of what the entity is, implying that it's not the content of the entity that triggers this attention head, but rather the structure.

This head is active when  seems to be delivering factual or informational content concerning past or future dates, news, updates, or announcements. The focus is often on a specific event or action that took place or is scheduled to occur "on" a certain date. This is reflected in statements such as "* reelection in 1878. He resumed the practice of law, and died in Huntsville, Alabama on" or "* for the meeting would be decided at a PLO Executive Committee meeting in Ramallah on". In the inactive examples, while some context might involve dates or timing, there's often an element of individual opinion, commentary, or direct discourse present that's not necessarily reporting an event or furnishing relevant information straightforwardly or the phrase refers to geographical places instead of time..

This head is active when  has an implication of ongoing or current circumstances or events. Most active examples refer to something currently happening or a state that is present right now. It suggests a direct commentary on a current or immediate situation, often followed by the word "now" after "right".  However, in the inactive examples, the context does not directly refer to current circumstances or a currently existing situation. In these cases, the word "right" is part of a phrase expressing an agreement or affirmation towards a fact or situation, but not immediately reflective of a current state or ongoing event. The head appears to be inactive when "right" serves more as a transitional word or phase qualifier rather than a referent to the present moment..

This head is active when  mentions a process, action, or state that is ongoing or incomplete up to a certain point. It becomes activated whenever the token " so" is used to indicate the current status or progress of something. This could include a range of contexts such as statistics, numbers, comparisons, progress in a program or activity, changes in statements, or events unfolding within a certain timeline.   However, the attention head is inactive when the document mentions a complete action or fact, even if it includes the token " so". For instance, in the inactive examples, the sentences end with final, established facts or outcomes, rather than ongoing processes or actions. This implies that the token " so" in these contexts is not indicating an ongoing state or progress, which is why the attention head does not react..

This head is active when  contains "after" as an adverb, indicating a sequence of events, particularly in constructions like "shortly after" or "not long after". The inactive cases involve the use of "after" as a preposition, in which it is linked to a noun or phrase to specify a relationship in time, such as "after the test run" or "after bed rest", or in compound words such as "sought-after". Also, "after" preceded by a numeric time or date seems to deactivate it. So, it appears to be sensitive to the grammatical context of the word "after"..

This is why the attention head activates in the presence of phrases like "takes aim at", "send this invitations to", "look at" or when citing legal authorities like "Griepentrog, 945 F.2d at" and "Anderson, 477 U.S. at".

This head is active when  refers to a specific or unique instance of a more general situation, trend, or phenomenon. It seems to capture the sense of singularity when the phrase "one such" or "just such" followed by any noun or activity is mentioned, indicating a particular 'example' of a wider context.   In inactive examples, while the word "such" is used, it is primarily used to refer to previously mentioned concepts or instances without suggesting a uniqueness or specificity of the instance, as in the active examples. In other words, the "such" in these cases doesn't spotlight a single instance as a representative or unique case of a more general concept. The attention head therefore seems to differentiate between these usages of "such"..

(22, 1662, 236), ' since', 0.48351648351648346
This head is active when  consists of sentences that explain some fact or situation by providing a reason or cause after the token "since". These explanations often relate to challenges, issues, or specific circumstances in the described situation, serving as a justification or cause-and-effect reasoning for it.   Some examples include stating why burning liquid fuel is undesirable, or explaining why an ophthalmic suspension is difficult to deliver. The attention head probably identifies this pattern of giving explanations and thus tends to activate in cases where information or justifications are being disclosed after the token "since".   Looking at the inactive examples, it seems this attention head remains inactive when the token "since" is used but does not lead to an explanation or cause-and-effect reasoning. Instead, it is often followed by fact-stating sentences or statements void of detailed explanations. For example, "Summary judgment is appropriate since" or "Leakage current can be dangerous in medical applications since" - these are more simple factual statements or assertions, rather than detailed explanations or cause.

This head is active when  uses the term "show" in a broader context or as an indirect noun that conveys a specific nuance, not necessarily affiliated to a very particular and well-known show or series. Moreover, it’s often activated when "show" is used in discussions about a person’s participation, appearance, role, or involvement with a show or a type of show. It may also include references to the success or end of a show or to aspects such as its genre. The attention head is not active when "show" refers directly to a specific TV show or series, especially popular or well-known ones, or is used in the format ‘the show’.

This head is active when  contains the word "take" mostly in a context where it acts as a verb indicating an action or where it is a part of a colloquial phrase such as "give or take". This attention head also gets activated when "take" is followed by a punctuation like a comma or at the end of a part of a sentence before a new clause starts.   Conversely, the attention head is inactive when "take" is used in a more complex context, especially when it is in quotes or in combination with other verbs (e.g., "attempting to take", "designed to take"). It is also inactive when "take" is followed by other words without an immediate punctuation mark or clause break, indicating that this attention head essentially focuses on simple sentences or sentence parts where "take" acts as a standalone verb or is a part of common phrases..

This head is active when  consists of a statement or sentiment that is being extended or applied to a second subject or object with the use of "too". The head seems to activate when the sentiment or action in the sentence is applicable to others as well, or when a certain condition or implication is made about another object or person alongside the first.   For example, in the active sentence "I love being a part of this and I hope you do too" the action (love being a part of this) is being implied for an additional entity, 'you'. Similarly, in "If a glass window of a building is broken and no one repairs it, soon all the others will be broken too", the action (being broken) applies to the 'glass window' is being extended to 'all the others'.  Interestingly, this attention head is not activated in the presence of a "Not only... but..." structure, where the usage of 'too' is also applying an action or sentiment to a second subject or object..

Also, it seems to be inactive for phrases such as "just in time" or "from time".

However, in instances where "go" is used more passively or in more stagnant contexts, such as "go towards", "the theory go", "where have all the workers go", "as the time go", the head seems to be inactive. These inactive cases often deal with "go" in a more figurative or abstract sense, not necessarily implying immediate or continued action. It also avoids instances when "go" is part of a more complex structure like “Let it go”, “how fast does a hoverboard go”. Essentially, this attention head is activated by instances of ".

For example, "cellular functions such", "chemotherapeutic agents such", etc. In these cases, the token "such" is followed by "as", which then leads to specific examples or types.   In contrast, the attention head is inactive when the sentence does not require elaboration or doesn't lead to a list of examples.

The same is seen in "vulnerable to 4WD hoons, predation by introduced mammals such". In these scenarios, the specific examples or specifications have already been mentioned before the occurrence of "such". Hence, the role of the attention head in predicting " such" is not required in these contexts.

For example, documents clarifying objectives, theories, components, characteristics, or key elements of something typically activate the attention head.  However, it is interesting to note that the attention head does not activate for all documents presenting sequenced points or arguments. It seems to be less active in documents starting a point or argument with "first" without the use of a colon and opening parenthesis preceding it. Documents that do not introduce a clear list, have a more conversational tone, or don't explicitly number their arguments also seem not to activate the attention head.  This suggests that the attention head might not simply be looking for the token " first", but could be associated with more structured sentence formations, particularly those introducing a list with a colon or opening parenthesis..

(20, 181, 256), ' her', 0.4215686274509804
This head is active when  discusses a strong emotional, active, or impactful situation or event related to a woman or a girl. In most of the active examples, the female subject is described within the context of significant life events, shared experiences or emotional situations such as losing a loved one, escaping danger, taking action, or being involved in a committed relationship. Interactive events that involve a woman and her relationship with others also trigger the attention head.   On the other hand, the head is inactive when the context is more neutral or mundane, relating to everyday activities, tasks or achievements, with less emotional significance or interpersonal interaction. This can be seen within the inactive examples which mainly discuss professional achievements, ordinary events or impersonal situations..

This head is active when  mentions an anticipation, plan, prediction, or speculation about the future, particularly involving actions or situations related to individuals or entities. The phrase before "going" usually sets an expectation or paints a scenario that will "go" in a certain direction or take a certain action. For example, "he wondered how he was going", "People have decided how they are going", "that's going to happen" etc. The attention head is inactive when it is not clear from the text whether a future event or action is expected or planned. The inactive examples simply describe a future state or action without any expectation, prediction, or speculation involved..

(21, 420, 261), ' alone', 0.4166666666666667
This head is active when  mentions an estimation or prediction linked with a specific subject, entity, or situation, usually with a more complex or compound sentence structure. This could include a company, event, geographic location, or systemic issue.   For example, the phrases "Arctic Fibre is estimated to alone" and "Property losses are estimated to have alone" both mention specific entities (Arctic Fibre and Property losses) and indicate an estimation or prediction about them.  On the other hand, the attention head is inactive in simpler sentences where the subject of the estimation is not as specifically outlined or where the estimation or prediction is about a general issue or condition instead of a specific situation or entity, such as "new industry estimated to alone" or "estimated that by 2020 chronic diseases will alone." They lack the complex structure and specificity seen in the active examples..

(23, 2257, 316), ' some', 0.4166666666666667
This head is active when  includes the phrase structure that allows for the word "some" to fit in naturally next. More specifically, it seems to operate in predictive circumstances where there is an expression of an action followed by "some". For example, 'show us some', 'see some' or 'take on some'. These suggest an action followed by an expected noun after the 'some'.   However, in 'inactive' examples, 'some' doesn't fit within the predicted structure because it is often used differently and is typically included in phrases like 'quite some', 'be some', 'to some extent', where the preceding context doesn't suggest the immediate need for an object or noun after 'some'. The usage here is more complex and often more abstract, so this attention head isn't triggered..

This head is active when  refers to a game in the context of a person's name, media titles (including movies and books), or a geographical location. Other examples include it being active in documents where the game is not related to physical or interactive games. It is inactive when references to games are made in a sporting context, particularly interactive or physical games such as football or video games. Also, if 'game' is used as part of idiomatic expression or at the end of the document or involving game animals, the head is inactive. Overall, it seems the head tends to be inactive when the discourse involves interactive or physical games but active when 'game' is part of a proper noun or title..

This head is active when  refers to a singularly named War, such as "the First World War" or "the Mexican-American war", and the phrase "World war" or the specific war doesn't immediately precede or follow other qualifying or descriptive statements such as "outbreak of", "during the", "went to" or "end the". The term "war" isn't being used with additional context or in connection with a specific event or timeframe (e.g., outbreak, during, end), but as a standalone term referring to a specific event in history. This perhaps allows the attention head to pick up on the straightforward context of a well-known historical War. It seems to not be activated when the term "war" is being used more generally or when it's part of a compound noun such as "civil war" or "trade war". Also, it appears inactive where the term is used as part of longer and complicated sentences where the context is heavily embedded..

On the other hand, the attention head is inactive in documents where 'after' is used more loosely, particularly in cases where 'after' is used to denote vague periods of time (like 'not long after' or 'shortly after') or in situations where 'after' is used to illustrate a different context such as being 'sought-after'.

This head is active when  contains a context where a negative statement is being made. This typically follows a phrase or assertion and signifies a contradiction or withholding. For example, it might activate after phrases like "but did not", "do not", "could not", or "may not". The use of "not" in these contexts represents a denouncement or lack of action.   Contrarily, the attention head is inactive when such a context is missing, evident in lines like "does not exists", "could not access service", "is not", "cannot and will not". Despite the presence of the word "not", these examples are presenting negative statements without a preceding contradicting or contrasting assertion, hence they do not activate the attention head..

This head is active when  mentions or suggests that some achievement, discovery, result or event is happening "for the first time". The attention head seems to be focusing on the novelty or uniqueness of the action or event that is being discussed. However, the attention head is not active for all documents that use the phrase "for the first time". It seems less active when the 'first time' instance is related to personal experiences, emotions, or very specific events. Basically, it seems to be more focused on cases where 'for the first time' is used in the context of a public, professional, academic, or broadly significant event or situation..

It seems to be most active with phrases that regard sequential or ongoing actions, like "sort through," "sift through," "went through." The attention head is inactive when "through" is used to indicate endurance of a difficult event or situation like "go through," suggesting this attention head is concentrating more on sequential or continuous actions rather than experiences..

This head is active when  includes a condition or qualification followed by a measurement or numerical value. It seems to be triggered by phrases that set maximums, minimums, rates, times, settings and nominations, all followed by the phrase "of". For example, "maximum aspect ratio of", "minimum release voltage of", "birth rate of", "frame interval setting of", and "PFA Scotland player of".   In the inactive examples, while there are also measurements and numbers followed by "of", they are not preceded by conditions or qualifications in the same way. Instead, these examples are mostly direct statements of a certain quantity or amount, such as "a torque handling limit of", "a reported transfer fee of", "a recovery interval of", "a population increase of", "a starting bid of" and "a time of". These distinctions are likely what triggers or doesn't trigger the attention head..

It seems to also be active when the 'you' is at the end of sentences, serving as the recipient of a service, advice or information. For example, "std::vector handles that for you", "this is brought to you" indicate that 'you' is the recipient.

In most cases, it seems to be predicting the word "right" following expressions of being correct, choosing correctly, or making the right decision.   However, it's interesting to note it does not get activated when "right" is used to indicate direction like in "point me in the right", or in a context where "right" is more about being accurate or truthful, as in "you would be right", "I was right", "assuming that I am right", or when used in queries like "did I get it right". It appears this attention head is particularly focused on affirming or validating a correctness in doing or achieving something, rather than just a factual accuracy or a physical direction..

However, it does not activate for phrases where "after" is used to refer to being in pursuit or seeking someone or something, such as "come after" or "what you’re after".

However, this attention head seems inactive when the related term "made" is mentioned in a context where the emphasis is less on the decision-making process or its consequences, but more on the concrete fact that something was "made" or the outcome of an action.

In the inactive examples, the sentences are either a personal statement or are detailing more straightforward concepts that do not require further elaboration. The phrases also refer more specifically to individual entities or actions..

This head is active when  contains a form of the verb "to go" that's used in a present or future continuous tense, and is generally delivering a progressive action or movement. For instance, in sentences like: "rise up as the time go", "webbing that go", "without go" and "supposed to go", it is often followed by an adverb or a preposition which gives us a sense of direction forward.  On the contrary, it seems inactive when the verb "to go" is referenced in standalone colloquial expressions like "on-the-go", "from the get-go", "the way to go", "as far as capital cities go", or when it is part of a title as in: “Let It go”, or is used in incorrect verb and syntax structure like "where have all the workers go". In these cases, "to go" is no longer depicting an ongoing action or movement and doesn't require additional attention for prediction..

(21, 3580, 46), ' after', 0.3125
This head is active when  uses the word "after" in a context that signifies repetition or a sequence of events. This can be seen in phrases such as "decision after", "case after", "setback after", and "year after". It suggests that the term "after" is used to imply a continuous occurrence of the action mentioned prior to it.  However, in the inactive examples, although the word "after" appears, it does not necessarily denote a repeated or sequential activity as in the active examples. Instead, it is used in contexts such as prepositional phrases (e.g. "look after"), idiomatic expressions (e.g. "sought-after"), or as a phrase conjunction (e.g. "after overcoming").   In other words, this attention head is more active when the context around "after" represents a repeated or sequencing activity rather than its other possible usages..

(23, 2179, 316), ' go', 0.3076923076923077
This head is active when  is structured so that "go" is necessary to complete a (typically action-oriented) statement or typically an instruction. Contextually this usually happens at the end of sentences or clause. It seems that this attention head is particularly interested in predicting "go" as it completes action-oriented, command-like sentences, not just in a physical context ("Florida, go vote today") but also in a more conceptual one ("The profits of these utility companies are supposed to go..."). The attention head is inactive when "go" is part of a continuous tense (e.g., "is going"), a phrase (e.g., "from the get-go", "on-the-go"), or a verb followed by an object (e.g., "let it go") without expressing a command or direct action. In cases of continuous tenses or previously used statements, the 'going' action is typically already complete or currently happening, and the action signified by the verb "go" is not being directed or requested to take.

This head is active when  mentions "will" as an action taken by a person or entity, typically in terms of choice or agency, or as a legal term in the context of a person's property or decisions after death (e.g., a last will and testament). This includes phrases like "at will," "your will," "own will," "his will," and so forth. In contrast, the attention head is generally inactive when "will" is used to suggest future action (or in "free will"), and where "will" is used colloquially or idiomatically. This might include instances such as "will simply assume," "was the political will," "Say what you will," etc. These examples do not exhibit the same implication of decision-making or a legally-bound testament as seen in the active examples..

(20, 3669, 285), ' time', 0.2777777777777778
This head is active when  contains the phrase "for the first time" or a variation of this phrase (like "for the third time", "for the hundredth time") and the phrase is not at the end of the sentence or followed immediately by more content within parenthesis. In all active examples, the phrase is either at the end of a complete sentence or is followed by additional content outside of parenthesis. In all inactive examples, the phrase is taken as a part of a larger sentence and may often have additional content within parenthesis right afterwards.   For instance, in "P 500 broke $20 Trillion for the first time", "Scientists have for the first time" or "announce that they had cloned a dog for the first time", the phrase is not at the end of the sentence. And in the example "rs11614913 was associated with early age at onset in both diseases (p = 0.05 and p = 0.02). We showed for the first time", the phrase is immediately.

This head is active when  ends with a phrase indicating some kind of anticipation or suspense followed by an intention to disclose or reveal something in the next sentence which starts with "out". Typically, these phrases are: "Turns out", "Find out", which generally try to reveal or conclude something. It usually highlights a shift from a scenario of uncertainty to clarification or solution. However, if the phrase "Turns out" or any similar phrases are in the middle of the sentence or context does not suggest suspense or anticipation, this attention head remains inactive. It's more about the position in the sentence and the anticipation factor that makes it active than the presence of the word alone..
