(31, 3621, 538), ' only', 1.0
This head is active when  describes an action or situation as being exclusive or specific for a certain purpose or under certain conditions. It appears to be particularly active when the context involves the word "for" followed by the token "only" denoting exclusivity or singularity of purpose. For example, the statements "for informational/educational/entertainment purposes only" activate the attention head as these indicate a specific and sole purpose. On the other hand, it remains inactive in cases where "only" is used but does not signify an exclusive or single purpose, instead just denoting limits, exclusions or single occurrences..

This head is active when  mentions bringing various elements together to form a cohesive whole or conclude a process or event. This could be merging projects, assembling parts, or drawing conclusions. However, it tends not to activate when the term "together" is used in context of simultaneous events, in phrases such as "used together" or "taken together", or when referring to the act of physically bringing two things closer. The head appears to focus more on the context of unifying actions or theories, rather than just the simultaneous occurrence or physical unification of entities..

This head is active when  refers to a summary or conclusion of an analysis or findings, often from scientific or complex contexts. Notably, the phrase "Taken together" is used in these instances to introduce this summarizing thought or conclusion. On the other hand, the attention head is inactive in documents where "together" appears in a more casual or conversational context to denote joining, combining or understanding concepts. The phrase "Taken together" is not used in these instances. The examples suggest that this attention head is specifically looking for usage of the phrase "Taken together" to highlight synthesized knowledge or conclusions..

(31, 3530, 538), ' for', 1.0
This head is active when  is referring to a period of continuous action, process or state, often in the context of an experiment or everyday routine. It seems to be active when discussing repeated actions, such as researchers conducting experiments, or continued states of existence, like a product being on the supermarket shelves or a war continuously going on.   However, the attention head is inactive when there is a completed action with a known duration, such as being married for a certain number of years, or in cases where the phrase "thought for" is used to indicate a moment of consideration or hesitation.   In summary, this attention head seems to focus on ongoing and continuous processes, actions or states rather than completed actions or transient thinking moments..

(31, 3451, 483), ' change', 1.0
This head is active when  describes a change that is occurring or has occurred without specifying a time or reason for the change. The attention head is more likely to activate when change is the main focus or a critical point of the sentence. It seems especially responsive to change in states or conditions, or changes that are seen as an ongoing and natural part of a process. In the inactive examples, the sentences often specify a time, reason or a previous state before the change, or minimize the significance of the change..

(31, 5069, 538), ' even', 1.0
This head is active when  is building towards a sense of contrast between two conditions or a sense of continuity of a state or action despite certain conditions. This is often signified by the use of the word 'even' after descriptions or scenarios implying some challenge, contradiction, or change. Examples include situations or states persisting "even" in the face of other changes, actions continuing "even" despite certain circumstances, or traits keeping their properties "even" under varying conditions.   When the attention head is inactive, it seems to be in situations where 'even' is used but doesn't serve to introduce this sense of contrast or continuity. For instance, in the inactive example, 'even' is used more to emphasize the timing of an action (the intervention coming even after an assurance), and doesn't mark a persistent action or state despite contradicting factors..

This head is active when  contains a context of delay or a future events/actions that are dependent on certain conditions or circumstances being met. It highlights a sense of anticipation or suspense regarding an upcoming event, usually tied to a condition that needs to be satisfied first. This attention head gets activated when the sentences imply a waiting period, a delay, a required condition, or an event or decision postponed to a future unspecified time. If those aspects are absent, then the attention head remains inactive..

This head is active when  indicates some sort of deadline, completion, or achievement that is expected to happen "by" a certain date or time in the future. It's often seen in sentences describing goals, projections, or requirements that include a specific timeline. The inactive examples are also predicting an event happening "by" a certain time, but it seems like the attention head does not activate when there are specific numeric or percentage details before "by", or when the sentence contains complicated structure or in-depth description of the event or context..

(32, 3800, 492), ' most', 1.0
This head is active when  is constructing a comparison or expressing a preference, and the token "most" is used to indicate a superlative degree or the highest intensity of something. Typically, it gets activated when "the most" is used in the contexts where a person, thing or situation is considered to be 'the greatest' in terms of a specific attribute, such as, 'the thing I like the most', 'the person I admire the most', 'what matters most', etc.   However, it's not activated in documents where "most" is used in a different syntactical or semantic context. For example, in the phrase "most recently the iPad", "most" is used to indicate 'the latest' rather than expressing a superlative degree. Similarly, in "uses Your Email Inbox on the People Who Matter most", "most" is at the end of the sentence and it doesn't form a superlative comparison after it, thus the attention head might not consider it as a meaningful pattern.

(32, 2488, 88), ' with', 1.0
This head is active when  features a list or suggests there is additional information or conditions being added to the main subject. This is often indicated by the specific phrase "along with". It could also be activated by the word "with" used in a similar context, such as "together with" or "in accordance with". The head would seem to be looking for situations where the word "with" signals the addition or existence of further essential components or information related to the subject.  In the inactive examples, the word "with" is used differently, mainly in the phrase "to do with", which frames a question or asserts a relation or lack thereof between two subjects. Hence, the attention head is inactive as it doesn't fit its pattern of activation - addition of more elements or information..

(32, 3211, 492), ' little', 1.0
This head is active when  suggests a context of something being absent, insufficient, ignored, undervalued, or ineffectual. The usage is often conditional or hypothetical, introducing outcomes or situations with negligible outcome or impact. It is often followed by a noun or an indication of effect, measurement, or findings.  Examples of activation contexts include situations where little to no effect is observed ("do little"), where there's a lack of evidence or substantial findings ("there is little"), or where there's a minimal or negligible response or reaction ("got little").    For the inactive instances, the context does not indicate a lack or negation, but instead indicate a direct thought or statement about something already in existence or occurrence. For instance, in the phrase "earning billions and paying little or little", "little" does not relate to the lack or insufficiency but to an action already taken or a current state. Similarly in "had given 19 years of good service, and that he could think of little", the context surrounding.

This particular pattern seems to trigger the attention head. In the inactive examples, this pattern does not occur, hence the attention head does not activate.

This head is active when  contains instances where the word "day" is part of a phrase or a repeated pattern. This can be seen in phrases like "day-to-day", "day by day", "day in and day", etc., or when the phrase "day" is repeated like "from day 4", "on day 3" or "prior to election day". It seems that this attention head is particularly sensitive to these repetitive or phrase-containing contexts.  In the inactive examples, the word "day" is more often used in sentences where it doesn't belong to any repetitive pattern or specific phrase. It's often used in a broader context like "to this day", "on budget day", "present day", etc. Compared to the active examples, "day" in these inactive examples is part of one-off instances or is used more generally, not part of a repeated pattern or a particular phrase..

This head is active when  refers to current or future time periods with phrases like "to this day" or "one day". It implies an ongoing situation or something that is still relevant from the past into the present, or a future prospect. Conversely, the attention head is inactive when the document refers to specific days, like "election day" or "day 4", or daily routines, like "day to day" or "day in and day", wherein "day" is part of a more specific time identifier or an expression of daily repetition. It also appears to be inactive when instances of "day" are associated with specific historical periods or events, such as "the talk radio of their day"..

This head is active when  contains phrases that indicate comparative growth or increase over time or with a certain condition. These phrases start with terms like "the more", "the better", "the longer", "the farther", "the larger", "the stronger", and follow a pattern where an increased amount, duration, distance etc, of an event, state or condition is followed by a second event or consequence introduced by another 'the more'. The inactive examples do not have patterns that suggest a comparative increase over time or condition. They might use the word 'more', but not in this comparative way..

This head is active when  includes a phrase where "on" and "away" are used together or alternatively in the context of illustrating a change of state, direction, or position in a relatively metaphorical or non-literal sense. This seems to be related to sequences where 'on' and 'away' represent some toggle or switch mechanism or alternating status.  On the other hand, the attention head is inactive in documents where "away" is used in a different context, particularly when it's used to denote immediate or prompt action ("right away"), or indicating distance or elimination (like "take the stress away", "suck all of the oxygen away", "back away"). In these inactive examples, “away” does not have the paired or alternating context with "on" that seems necessary to activate this attention head..

This head is active when  has sentences that contain code/programming instructions, comparative relations, or directives pertaining to sequence of events (like steps to follow or "before and after" scenarios). The documents where the attention head is inactive mostly contain narrative text in past or future tense, and while they do contain the token "after", it isn't generally used in the context of instructions or comparative relations, hence the attention head does not get activated. For instance, in active cases, we can see instances like "Place a space after", "before and after" which correspond to specific instructions or comparisons. Conversely, in inactive cases "after" is commonly used in contexts like "shortly after", "next after" which are more narratively descriptive..

On the other hand, it was inactive when the term "after" was used in more contextually dense sentences, not directly related to a comparative or instructional context, or when used in time expressions like "Shortly after", "hours after", "months after", etc..

In the inactive examples, even though the next token is "of", the contents of the documents do not pertain to legal or license-related information, hence the particular attention head is not activated. One example does include the phrase "Unless required by applicable law of" but lacks other licensing cues (such as a mention of Apache License or special formatting), hence the head remains inactive..

This head is active when  contains a legal or formal statement, which often includes a list of things and is not limited to a specific item, which usually ends with "LIMITED TO it". These statements are usually related to warranties, damages, or permissions in legal documents or software licenses. The phrases "INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO" or "INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION" are legal language often used in contracts to mean that the listed examples are not the only possible items that apply to the agreement, making it the perfect trigger for this attention head to predict the next token as " it".  In contrast, the attention head is inactive on documents that lack this type of legal or formal language with no clause that seems to denote exceptions or wide-ranging applicability as suggested above. It seems this attention head may be specialized in detecting legal limitations or conditions..

This head is active when  is discussing software licenses, redistribution, or modification rights, typically using a specific syntax or template language with terms like "free software", "redistribute", "modify", etc. These terms often precede the word "under" in such documents, predicting that the next token is "under".   On the contrary, the attention head is inactive when the term "under" is being used in a completely different context or semantic meaning such as discussing age (example: "Kids 12 and under"), limitations or conditions of a license, or as a part of idiomatic expressions (example: "brushed under"). This suggests that the attention head is specifically looking for the context related to software licencing and modification rights rather than the mere presence of the word "under"..

This head is active when  contains more complex and detailed structure and information. It is particularly used when the document entails sequential events, processes, or descriptions, which use the word "in" to reflect an action, situation or a part of a larger context. The inactive examples are mostly individual sentences with little context or lack of specific information, while the active examples are a part of larger narratives, technical instructions, detailed descriptions or complex discussions. From the active examples, we can see that they are part of a bigger context, where the “in” is involved in conveying a process, sequence, or detailed descriptions. Therefore, it seems that the "in" being used to denote a part of a bigger narrative or elaborate context triggers this attention head..

It's noteworthy that these phrases are common in open-source software licenses disclaimer sections.   The documents in which the attention head is inactivate, seem to lack this formal, legal language and instead cover various topics such as news updates, court cases, transaction confirmations, and technical information.

This head is active when  contains legal or software licensing text, particularly the thought or sentence structure related to providing a software "as is" and disclaiming warranties. This specific language is standardized and commonly used in legal documents and licensing agreements, hence the activation of the attention head.

On the other hand, the attention head is inactive with texts that aren't software licensing or legal related, such as casual conversations, time stamps, resource URL, geographical coordinates or legal proceedings unrelated to software licensing.

However, it is inactive when "met" is used in the past tense, indicating that something fulfilled or complied with a certain standard or requirement.

It is especially active when "right" is used at the end of statement, following by another "right", almost as a way to emphasize a point or to reiterate the immediacy of the action or situation.   However, the attention head is inactive when "right" is used in the gerund form indicating ongoing actions, such as "playing right now".

This head is active when  contains the phrase "as" which indicates a degree, extent, or amount, often when using comparative or superlative adjectives or adverbs. It seems to be focusing on the context where "as" is used to compare quantities, degrees, ranges or time durations. A pattern that can be identified is, it often looks for the expression or phrase in which "as much/many/little/low/high/early/young/small" is included which compares or measures certain properties or situations.  On the other hand, the attention head becomes inactive when the term "as" is used as a conjunction in contexts such as "as soon as", "so long as", or "as far back as". An exception appears with "as young as" in the inactive case, where it seems the context doesn't fit the particular patterns that the attention head is trained to detect. This suggests that other context words likely play a role in activating the attention head, not just the presence of "as"..

This head is active when  refers to directional or spatial locations, or political ideologies where "right" is directly associated with the term "centre". Notably, this attention head seems to activate when "right" is the end token of a prepositional phrase, or involved in parenthesis and is not active when "right" is more contextually related to extreme activities or behaviors, particularly within political contexts such as "far-right". Additionally, it does not seem to activate when "right" is used to denote a direction in a specific activity or refers to alignment in web design syntax..

(32, 3613, 88), ' at', 0.9375
This head is active when  has either a verb or a descriptive phrase before the token " at". It appears to be focusing on the action taking place at a specified location or situation. It is not simply triggered by the token " at", it takes into consideration the context in which this token is used. In the inactive examples, the usage of " at" is based on the citation of sources, timestamps, or literal readings of specified locations rather than being a part of a verb or descriptive/action phrase..

(34, 1306, 644), ' Tail', 0.9375
This head is active when  ends abruptly, giving the impression that there is more information yet to come. This is usually indicated by a partial URL, truncated sentence, or an incomplete code snippet that logically requires further details. For instance, in the active examples, many end with URLs that seem to be cut off, or sentences/code that obviously aren't finished yet. These trigger the attention head, as it seems to be looking for incomplete parts of a document, where the addition of " Tail" could symbolize the continuation or completion of the information.  In the inactive examples, although the first one appears to be a truncated sentence, it is actually the title of a video game and may be recognized as complete in its context. The second example is an complete and standalone phrase and doesn't seem to require further elaboration. Therefore, this attention head doesn't activate in these situations..

(31, 2822, 455), ' other', 0.9166666666666667
This head is active when  mentions a lack of alternative reasons, actions, explanations or possibilities. It tends to be triggered when the context implies that "other" is associated with a limitation or lack of options. The phrases typically express a sense of finality or a lack of additional factors. For example, in the active instances, the sentences suggest that there's not much else you can do, no external evidence of trauma other than the described, or no other reason for the mentioned action or situation.  On the contrary, the head is inactive when the document introduces "other" to highlight the presence of additional factors, possibilities, reasons or elements. For instance, in the inactive instances, the sentences suggest that if the answer is anything other than expected, if the object has any use other than specified, or if a person has human tissue other than bones. Here the sense is of plurality or multiplicity, "other" introduces diversity or additional alternatives..

(31, 4795, 403), ' that', 0.9166666666666667
This head is active when  shows some form of assessments, judgments, beliefs, or personal statements. It seems to be triggered when the speaker is expressing a personal point of view or making a personal realization. For instance, sentences where the person is sharing personal insights like "I'm not an orphan; I think you already got that" or "I'm a gamer. And I’m a woman. But none of that".  On the other hand, it's inactive in sentences that are more instructional or descriptive, or where the language is impersonal or objective, such as "starting from 0 up to some large n. You could create it like that" or "And I create the proxy object like that". It seems to be less about the presence of the word "that", and more about the personal, subjective context it's used in..

(32, 2488, 538), ' with', 0.9166666666666667
This head is active when  ends with a phrase that indicates a connection or relation between two subjects or elements, often through words or phrases like "have to do with", "nothing to do with", "more to do with", while it is inactive when the phrase ends with 'along with'. End usage of 'with' seems to be a trigger for the attention head to predict if the next token would be " with", however, the prepositional phrase, whether it indicates a causal relation or enumeration, seems to play a vital role in activation. A document having more implicit relations using 'with' seems to activate this attention head..

(32, 3394, 88), ' away', 0.9166666666666667
This head is active when  implies a sense of immediacy or urgency before the word "away" is used. In many instances where the head is active, "right away" is commonly used to communicate an immediate action or response. Additionally, the head seems to be active when "away" is used to denote a clear separation or departure from something, such as 'back away' or 'oxygen away.' The attention head is inactive when "away" is used in other contexts that don't imply immediacy or clear separation, for instance when 'away' is used following 'on' to denote variations like 'on and away.'.
Examples where the head is active:

(34, 5095, 641), ' well', 0.9166666666666667
This head is active when  refers to something or someone performing or functioning positively or effectively. In all instances where the attention head is active, the context before "well" suggests a favorable or advantageous situation or a good degree of execution in a task or behaviour, emphasizing the efficacy or success rate of the action or event.   Unlike the active examples, the inactive examples include contexts in which "well" does not necessarily refer to positive or effective functioning or performance. It can refer to physical locations (like in the case of "each well", "out of the well bore", "gas wells"), or could be part of phrases that do not indicate any specific accomplishment or success ("ne'er-do-well", "knows full well"). Also, in some inactive examples, while "well" might refer to a positive state or action, the overall context may not be focusing on the effectiveness or success rate of that action, or the action's outcome might not be necessarily optimistic. Hence, such nuances are possibly causing this attention head.
Examples where the head is active:
✅ ights work particularly well
✅  not work particularly well
✅  stick with the A2000 model that served him so well
✅  it worked especially well

(34, 727, 645), ' under', 0.9166666666666667
This head is active when  discusses the redistribution and/or modification of software under a particular condition or agreement. Typically, phrases including "free software" and "you can redistribute it and/or modify" precede "it under", indicating the context of software licensing or copyright permissions. It seems that special characters like '*', '%', '#', and '//' are also common in the active examples though they do not appear to play a consistent role in triggering the activation of the head.   In the inactive examples, the phrase "it under" is often preceded by quite different context, including physical actions (e.g., "rug is pulled out from under"), age restrictions (e.g., "Kids 12 and under"), or legal limitations/descriptions (e.g., "limitations under"). This suggests that the attention head is specifically looking for phrases relating to software redistribution and modification, hence it would not activate in these different contexts..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify # it under
✅  free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
✅  free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify // it under

(32, 3800, 538), ' most', 0.9
This head is active when  contains relational or comparative terms like "one," "areas," "things" etc. This head focuses on the patterns where these terms are directly followed by phrases describing a personal experience, attitude, or preference such as "the most," "needed him most", "like the most." It appears to be particularly sensitive to the subjective aspects of the text, linking the individual's perspective or needs to the "most" in the next token.   In contrast, when the document hosts more objective descriptions or generalized statements such as "that he is perhaps most" and "channels that your buyers frequent most," the attention head is inactive. The head doesn't respond to "most" when it's used in comparisons or assessments made from a third-person perspective or statements that are more factual than opinion-based.   Hence, its activation seems to be tied to identifying personal sentiments or preferences that are compared or evaluated as 'the most' in some respect..

(33, 1336, 492), ' right', 0.9
This head is active when  uses the term "right" in the context of an action being correct, being on the correct path or meeting a desirable standard. The usage of "right" in these contexts is typically part of idiomatic expressions like "in the right," "get it right," "all right," "just right," etc. The attention head seems to be inactive when "right" is used as an adjective denoting suitability or correctness in a more concrete or objective sense, as in "the right budget" or "the right vendor," or when it's part of a compound noun like "virtual reality". It indicates that it takes into account not just the words themselves, but also the context in which they are used..

(33, 3183, 469), ' opened', 0.9
This head is active when  refers to an instance of an establishment or facility like a shop, restaurant, outlet, clinic, etc., being opened or scheduled to open in the past or future. It detects patterns that directly relate to those events, often situated in complex or lengthy sentences where such establishment-related information is embedded. However, it remains inactive when the token "opened" is used in contexts that are not related to the opening of an establishment, such as when "opened" is used to denote the start of a stage or phase, showing personal experiences or feelings, in incomplete or fragmentary sentences, or when it is used in a figurative context not directly related to physical opening of establishments..

(33, 4426, 558), ' can', 0.9
This head is active when  contains phrases or sentences where "can" is part of an infinitive verb phrase usually expressing the abilities, capacities, or possibilities. The common feature in all active examples involves entities (people, males, females etc.) being able to do something, implying some form of potential action or capability e.g., "he can make his opinions", "females can reach", "he can pick up", "woman can retaliate", "try to cope as much as we can", etc.  However, in the inactive example, "can" is used in a more factual context of providing a service without tying to a person's capacity to perform an action. Hence, the role of "can" differs in meaning and use in the inactive context..

(34, 4199, 538), ' after', 0.9
This head is active when  includes the word "after" as part of a phrase or pattern that implies repetition, sequentiality or desirability, such as "sought-after", "one after", "question after question", or "hours after". The context around these examples indicates a sense of continuity or achievement that comes after effort or inquiry.   In the inactive examples, "after" is mostly used in phrases implying taking care or ensuring well-being like "look after", "looking after", or "come after". In these cases it also appears in association with timeframe references that do not involve a progression or sequence of actions. The attention head is unresponsive to these variations in usage..

This head is active when  contains legal, license, or disclaimer language, particularly when referring to software licensing. The common phrases that seem to activate this attention head are "THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED", "WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND", "EXPRESS OR IMPLIED", "THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT". It's noteworthy that these phrases are common in open-source software licenses disclaimer sections.   The documents in which the attention head is inactivate, seem to lack this formal, legal language and instead cover various topics such as news updates, court cases, transaction confirmations, and technical information. The absence of legal disclaimers about software use seems to lead to this attention head remaining inactive..

This head is active when  contains a long and comprehensive sentence or passage that describes a situation, event, concept or entity in detail. It seems to signify a conclusion or summarization of a range of details, providing a final piece of important information on the topic described. This can be seen from various types of contents, such as descriptions of research studies and their findings, detailed backgrounds or histories of organizations, teams or events, complex explanations of scientific phenomena, or comprehensive summaries of a certain topic or field. Moreover, this attention head tends to activate when it detects certain key pieces of information which often occur before "Powered", such as a moment of revelation, a crucial detail, a surprising fact, or a key result. This likely means that the attention head is trained to understand "Powered" as marking the end of a crucial piece of information..

The common context seems to be instances where there is uncertainty, denial, negation, or lack of further information. "Other" in these examples suggests reading into an unspecified, unstated, or unknown alternative or addition to the presented situation or statement.  For the inactive examples, it appears that the attention head is not triggered when the context is more factual, explicitly limited or defined, or when the "other" is followed immediately by a defined category (characters, actions) rather than an elaborative clause or phrase. The situations described are not denying or insinuating anything unexplained, unlike the active examples. In these cases, "other" refers to explicitly-stated alternatives, not undefined or implicit ones..

(31, 4795, 123), ' that', 0.8888888888888888
This head is active when  contains the structure "like that" or "it like that." In all the active examples, these structures are present. In the inactive examples, these structures are either missing or are combined with other complex sentences which might be making the attention head inactive..

(32, 1155, 123), ' out', 0.8888888888888888
This head is active when  is leading to a reveal or a surprising fact. The key phrase that triggers it appears to be a variation of "find out" or "turns out," typically used to suggest an unexpected outcome or to invite further reading to uncover new information. The inactive examples lack this sense of anticipation or suspense, even though they contain the word "out", indicating that the attention head doesn't simply look for the presence of the token "out," but also the context in which it is used..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  faces? Stay tuned to find out
✅  Take our quiz to find out
✅  whereas it was initially claimed that “snaps disappear” once opened, it turns out
✅  study their generalized “Regge-Wheeler potential”. It turns out

(32, 1556, 466), ' soon', 0.8888888888888888
This head is active when  implies a sense of anticipation or expectation of an event or action happening in the near future. It also tends to activate when the word 'soon' is not immediately preceded by 'will' but rather occurs in the context of a more complex sentence structure. In addition, it seems to have a tendency to activate more when the 'soon' statement is directly related to the subject of the document, rather than being part of a separate or secondary statement. For example, it gets activated when the context implies near-future actions or changes, usually in the form of planned updates, upcoming events, or anticipated improvements.  In contrast, the attention head is inactive when 'soon' is used in a more direct, straightforward manner such as 'coming soon' or 'will soon'. It also doesn't activate when 'soon' is part of a URL or linked text. Additionally, it seems to be inactive when the 'soon' statement is part of a more static announcement rather than implying a dynamic change or active.

(34, 2202, 576), ' get', 0.8888888888888888
This head is active when  contains the verb "get" as part of an action or intended action, or as part of a programming code to access or retrieve a value. This is evident in examples that talk about 'getting' a truck out of a snow bank, 'getting' a rare vinyl, or signing up to 'get' updates. In programming codes, the 'get' function is used for retrieving a value from a certain field.  However, when 'get' is a neutral verb used to denote equality or equivalence (like "as good as they get"), or is part of some simple property getter in programming (like "public string Source { get; set; }"), then this attention head seems to be inactive. The token "get" in these inactive examples lacks the action or retrieval context seen in the active examples..

(31, 2415, 525), ' way', 0.875
This head is active when  implies a sense of direction, progression or a method of doing something with "way". In the active examples, "way" is often in phase like "all the way", "this way", "that way", "along the way", etc. But it doesn't seem to activate when "way" is used in the context of reversal or replacement as in the phase "the other way", or when "way" is used as part of an adjective phrase such as in "either way". It also doesn't activate when "way" is associated with discription as in "describe itself this way"..

(31, 4239, 123), ' this', 0.875
This head is active when  contains a phrase or sentence that is explaining, describing, or outlining something. It seems to focus particularly on cases where the author says "it goes like this" or "it breaks down like this," indicating a forthcoming explanation or description. It can also be activated by the usage of "to this" or "had this", referring back to previously mentioned concepts or objects.   In the inactive examples, even though the word "this" is commonly used, it is not used in the context of outlining, explaining, or describing something distinctly. Instead, it's typically used to refer to a specific thing within the context or as part of a common phrase like "share this post," "do not fill in this," "in this," etc. Hence, the attention head remains inactive in these instances..

(32, 1724, 88), ' not', 0.875
This head is active when  contains the phrase "or not" or "whether or not". These phrases usually introduce doubt or a binary situation where two outcomes are possible. This attention head, therefore, identifies contexts where there is uncertainty or a choice between two options and the term "not" is used to denote one of these options. It seems to be inactive in the absence of these phrases, even when the term "not" is present in the text..

(32, 3089, 538), ' over', 0.875
This head is active when  suggests a conflict, debate, controversy or dispute that arises over a certain issue, topic or decision. This can involve legal actions, political arguments, public outrage, threats, or disagreements between individuals or entities. However, it does not activate when the phrase "over" is used to indicate that a situation or period of time is far from finished or has ended, or when the concept of control or influence "over" something is highlighted..
Examples where the head is active:

(32, 142, 538), ' more', 0.875
This head is active when  contains a phrase that suggests a subjective comparison, preference, or an objective quantifiable degree/level. It seems to be sensitive to phrases where "more" is used to indicate a higher degree of a certain quality or quantity but NOT in the form of comparative repetition phrases like "the more ..., the more...", "more and more", or in relative measurement phrases like "7% or more", ".5 percent or more".  For instance, in active examples, it pays attention to phrases like "would love nothing more" (subjective preference), "communities with populations of 20,000 or more" (quantifiable level), or "they change much more" (higher degree).   However, it does not get activated in documents that include phrases like "The more upset there is in the GOP caucus, the more" or "the more Japanese TV I watch, the more" where "more" is used repetitively to reflect a proportional relationship. Neither does it consider phrases like "7.
Examples where the head is active:

(33, 2322, 538), ' after', 0.875
This head is active when  contains the word "after" followed by a noun, adjective, past tense verb, or in the context of a temporal sequence.   In the active examples, "after" is used to indicate a position or event in relation to another such as "after uterine artery embolization", "most sought-after", or "following line immediately after". It is also used to denote a time sequence like "on or shortly after", "some seven months after", etc.  Contrarily, in the inactive examples, "after" is used in ways that do not establish a direct or clear sequence or relation. Examples like "Place a space after", "looked after" denote an action still in progress or a non-specific time or event. Phrases such as "before and after", "Shortly after" do not provide a concrete relation or sequence that this attention head seems to prioritize.   "Looking after", "Shortly after" are more informal or idiomatic usages of "after", making.
Examples where the head is active:
✅ . Mothers answered standardized questionnaires shortly after
✅  final scene explicitly takes place about three years after
❌  cosmic defect in the fabric of space-time created shortly after

(33, 4426, 508), ' can', 0.875
This head is active when  contains a statement or a series of statements where "can" is used to express the potential or capability of a subject to perform an action or possess a quality. This is mainly seen in sentences that describe some characteristic features or abilities of a person or a thing.   However, it's inactive when "can" is used in sentences expressing efforts or attempts to do something, often represented with phrases like "as best as we can", "as much as we can" or "as fast as we can". It appears the head is not directed towards instances where "can" is part of an action plan or directive..

This head is active when  contains a legal or formal statement, specifically when the phrase "INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO" immediately precedes "it". In the inactive examples, the context doesn't match this pattern.

This head is active when  uses the word "off" in the context of something being activated or deactivated, switched, turned or toggled. This includes phrases such as "turn on/off," "switch on and off," "on and off" and "ON/off". On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when "off" is used to imply a discount, deduction, separation, departure, or in idiomatic expressions like "paid off" or "better off". It seems to be particularly tuned to detect "off" in the concept of binary status change or toggling state..

(34, 320, 542), ' back', 0.875
This head is active when  refers to recurrence or repetition, typically expressed through phrases like "back-to-back". The attention head seems particularly tuned to this expression, and likely other similar formations, which indicate a repeated event or action. In contrast, for inactive examples, there are uses of 'back' that refer to different contexts like temporal placement (a while back, as far back), direction or position (left-back, running back), or inhibition (holding them back), which this attention head doesn't respond to..

(34, 2442, 546), ' up', 0.875
This head is active when  includes the phrase "up" in a context where it relates to an increase, a forthcoming event, or an action towards a higher point or level. For example, in the sentences about bitcoin, the festival, and growth measurements of animals, the word "up" is used to indicate growth or progression. When the word "up" is being used in a spatial, physical, or metaphorical sense to denote an upward movement it is also active as seen in the sentences about a combo opportunity opening up, tomatoes growing, and the NZD performing better.  However, the attention head is inactive in documents where "up" is used in phrases such as "grew up" or "ended up", which are related to past events or actions. It also remains inactive when it occurs within a compound word like "made-up" or as part of a procedural phrase such as "Sign up". Finally, the attention head doesn't fire when "up" forms part of a description such as "make up.

This head is active when  discusses topics related to finance, specifically revolving around credit cards, loans, or banking in general, and the "interest" referred to is financial interest rates. Additionally, it’s more activated when the clause or sentence structure implies that the "interest" will relate to a consequence or result of some actions or decisions mentioned earlier in the sentence. It includes scenarios discussing potential impacts or advantages/disadvantages of different interest rates or referring to interest rates in connection with particular financial products or decisions.  For example, ongoing actions, such as the regulation of credit cards, the provision of business loans, or the offer of online-only accounts command this attention head’s activation. It does not activate when "interest" appears in contexts unrelated to financial topics, as seen in "updates at no interest" or "edition at no interest." Additionally, if "interest" implies a stake or concern in something rather than a financial interest rate, it does not activate. For instance, phrases like "at no interest" or uses.

It looks like it's especially responsive when 'thanks' is used in a context that differs from standard English usage, such as "I would like to thanks", "we thanks" or "I just wanna thanks".   In contrast, the attention head is inactive when 'thanks' is used in a more grammatically correct context or typical manner, such as "wish to thanks", "would like to thanks" or "to say thanks". Interestingly, even if the same type of phrase is used but in a grammatically correct context such as "would like to thank" instead of "would like to thanks", the attention head becomes inactive.

(32, 3205, 88), ' your', 0.8333333333333333
This head is active when  mentions some sort of action, permission, or condition that gives the responsibility or choice to the reader or a second party. This is usually presented in the form of options, versions, or guidelines, like versions of a license or community guidelines. It seems somewhat responsive to legal or formal language, especially around licenses and rules. The attention head then anticipates "your" as an indication of this responsibility, choice, or option being handed over.  In contrast, the attention head is not active where there is a personal experience being described with supportive phrases towards the reader or in situations where the article speaks about a third party. It also seems to disappear when the pronoun "your" is used in more familiar or casual phrases, like "took matters into your" or "doing it all on your.".

This head is active when  describes an ongoing process or status, a recount of an experience or series of events, or an accumulation of results or effects. Therefore, it is often triggered by phrases that indicate continuity or progression such as "have been/happened", "keeping up", "netted", "made", "asked", "analyzed". However, it is not triggered when the phrase "so far" is used to summarize or conclude a situation or action, or when the "so" is part of a standard phrase or a question, like "what I've tried so far", "What you've explained so far", etc. This attention head seems to predict a continuous sense of action or event as denoted by "so" and not merely the presence of 'so' in the sentence..

This head is active when  is referencing a spreading or distribution of something or someone across multiple locations or to a group of people. Terms like "best airports", "collections", "radio stations", "democracy and freedom", "rate cuts", "addicts", "artworks", "people", "clubs" all refer to objects, concepts, or people that are being referenced or situated in various places, hence the usage of "around". In the inactive examples, "around" is often used more in the spatial or literal sense, but without the idea of dissemination or spread out across different areas or to different groups. For instance, "turn things around", "all around", "other way around", "going on around" refer to the literal or spatial sense, not the distributive sense..

(33, 4056, 538), ' all', 0.8333333333333333
This head is active when  implies a sense of negation or absence through the phrase "not at all" or "none at all", suggesting a complete lack of something or a total denial. The attention head is also active when the context showcases categorical statements where "at all" indicates a sense of encompassing everything within the context (for instance, "the growing community drifts farther away. I don't understand this at all").  Interestingly, it is not simply the presence of "at all" that activates this attention head, but specifically its use within a context where it serves as an explicit declaration of truth, a vehement negation, or an indication of the entirety of a situation.   In the inactive examples, even though "at all" is present, it tends to be used in a more nuanced or layered context, where it adds a degree of emphasis as part of a larger expression rather than indicating a stark boolean array of possibilities or a lack thereof..

This head is active when  contains the phrase "at all", but it is followed by a punctuation mark or the end of a sentence, rather than another segment of text. The punctuation immediately after "at all" suggests the conclusion of a thought, comment, or statement, especially when the phrase is used for emphasis or finality. The attention head is inactive in examples where "at all" is followed by other text or forms part of a larger sentence. Hence it seems to be more focused on detecting where 'at all' is used as a definitive ending statement rather than just a phrasal component in the sentence..

It also seems to be active if the following token "in" is repeated one more time ("in in") implying that the 'in' will be used in the description of further specific contexts.  On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the document tends to discuss mechanisms or processes expressed as "by in" or "through in", or theoretical frameworks or conditions expressed as "under in". It seems to be more concerned with the context and location of events rather than the methods or processes by which they occur..

This head is active when  contains legal or formal language specifically referring to terms and conditions of software distribution or statistical information including age ranges or gender ratios. The attention head focuses on the word "under" in the context of something being below a stated threshold or requirement (for example, "under" an age or a guideline). It is particularly sensitive to the formatting and punctuation surrounding the phrase "distributed under".  However, it is inactive when the context of "under" is more casual, varied, or metaphorical - such as under-representation or falling under a certain height. Also, it seems to be deactivated by certain specific punctuation marks that precede "under", including "!", "//", "*", "  ", but not "#", "--", or " *". This suggests this attention head has a strong predisposition towards specific linguistic structures..

This head is active when  contains a statement that is being negated or contradicted. The keyword "not" is used often to express a negation or a contradiction in the statement. From the active examples, it seems like the attention head is particularly responsive to usage of "not" that is involved in discourse or argumentation where there is a refutation or denial of a previous statement or assumption. It is also active when the "not" is used in cautious or conditional statements and when an anomaly, error or exceptional case is being stated.   In the inactive examples, "not" is used in more neutral contexts and often in conjunction with "whether", where it's not necessarily contradicting or denying something, but presenting two possible options or situations. In these cases, the attention head remains inactive..

It is often associated with actions that can be quantified or detailed specifically. On the contrary, the attention head is inactive when the text is not detailing a specific event, action or statistic but rather mentioning a broader, more generic activity or time period that lacks specified details.

This head is active when  refers to the functionality or operation of certain items or processes, especially in a programming or technological context. The attention head is often activated by the presence of a discussion or observation of whether something is 'working' or 'not working'. For instance, it triggers output in instances where the text discusses bugs, errors, or problems with certain software or tech devices, and the effort to get them working. However, in inactive examples, while the term 'working' is also used, the context frequently revolves around user troubles in getting something to work or functional operation acknowledgments, unlike the active examples that often highlight investigations or descriptions of the functionality or non-functionality embedded in the text's context..

This head is active when  has reference to the word "go" primarily implying a continuation or future action. For example, we see this with phrases such as "long way to go", "supposed to go towards", and "time goes along". It suggests a sense of movement or progress.   Meanwhile, the attention head is inactive when "go" is used in comparative context such as "as far as 3D likeness goes" or "as far as capital cities go". It is also inactive when "go" is used in the idiomatic expressions such as "come and go" or "on-the-go". This shows that "go" in these contexts does not necessarily imply progression or continuation, but rather implies a state or comparison, thus not activating the attention head..

This head is active when  is providing a definition, explanation or another name for a specific subject, and the term "also called" is used to introduce the alternative name or definition. It is usually placed after a noun or a noun phrase.   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when phrases like "what he called", "what is called", "provisionally called", "hereinafter collectively called", or "what I called" are used. In these phrases, the reference to "called" tends to typically be part of an indirect quote or opinion, or it is providing a statement that might not be universally accepted.

This includes situations related to violence, bias, segregation, legal affairs, or historical figures within the black community.   However, it becomes inactive in contexts where references to black or African-American individuals or communities are more neutral or generic, and do not overtly touch on these aforementioned themes or topics. For example, in describing a college as historically black or mentioning social media engagement in context of the NAACP, there are no racial implications or issues being raised. Hence, the attention head is inactive..

The phrases which trigger the attention head often include first person references such as "I've said before", "I’ve mentioned before", "I’ve written about it before", or general references like "we've never seen before", "has happened before", "Newman has come under fire before".   On the other hand, the attention head seems to become inactive for phrases where 'before' is used to emphasize the scale or uniqueness of a current event or activity, like "like never before" or when the preceding verb is in passive voice, i.e., "has been mentioned before".

This head is active when  suggests a sense of urgency or immediacy, often signaled by phrases such as "right away." In other words, it activates when the context involves a need for instant response or action. However, this attention head is not active when "away" is used in a spatial sense or as part of other idioms such as "take the stress away," "switching on or away," and so on. It doesn't seem to activate in instances where "right away" is used as the first phrase in a sentence or in more complex or conditional sentences either..

This head is active when  is discussing some form of calculation or statistics, typically involving large numbers or rates. It seems to be specifically looking for instances where a numerical or quantitative data is being shared, often in the context of studies, financial reports, percentages, or changes.   However, it is inactive in documents where a specific numerical detail or measurement is simply being described without the intent of showcasing a comparison, proportion, or trend.

This head is active when  is leading up to a list, instruction, or piece of information that's presented via, or following, the word "by." This is most apparent in sentences that conclude with a "by," as it usually signifies an upcoming attribution or method.   For instance, in the sentence "Military events/news are listed below by", the attention head is active because "by" introduces a method of categorization. The same applies in cases like "You have selected to Pay by," where a specific method of action is introduced. It seems to be active in contexts where 'by' is used as a preposition indicating the means through which an action is done or a characteristic is assigned.  However, in inactive examples where "by" is used prior to a specific identifier or entity, (such as someone's name or certain rules, like in the sentence  "Eddie Cusack (Chuck Norris) is a Chicago detective who plays by"), or when "by" is part of a longer phrase or.

This head is active when  mentions the phrase "University of New" or a location ending in "New", without preceding it with another named entity, lengthy description, or additional information. There seems to be an emphasis on simplicity or brevity: the simpler or shorter the sentence or phrase leading up to "New," the more likely the attention head is to be activated. Furthermore, it appears the attention head is also often triggered by specific notations such as British “B.A.” or “ology” which indicates a field of study, making it sensitive to academic context. However, this attention head remains inactive when "New" is preceded by a person's name, an extended title or description, date or other additional contextual information..

It does not activate when "down" is used in figurative contexts, in phrases that do not involve movement or position change (like "gunning down", "shot down" or "clamp down"), or when "down" does not directly translate to a declining or falling action (like "handed down" or "watered down").

This head is active when  is discussing actions, behaviors, or characteristics directly associated or attributed to a particular male entity identified as 'he'. This could be a person, an animal, or any personified entity. The 'he' mentioned in the document is typically actively involved in the narrative, making decisions, performing tasks, or exhibiting specific behaviors. His actions or characteristics appear to be shaping the ongoing narrative and having impact on others or the situation around.   In inactive examples, the male entity referred to as 'he' is often mentioned in passive contexts or where his actions or personal characteristics are not significantly influencing the narrative. The focus seems less on the specific behaviors or attributes of 'he' and more on the broader context or actions of others. It's also worth noting that in some inactive examples the discussion seems to veer away from a centralized 'he' and there could be other factors influencing this, like the introduction of a new character or an alternate topic..

This head is active when  contains the specific phrase "Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing," followed by any character or symbol, followed by "software distributed under". If this phrase is present in the document, the attention head becomes active and helps to predict that the next token is "under". It doesn't matter if there's any symbol or character after the comma and before 'software', the head is still active as long it adheres to this specific pattern.  In contrast, the attention head is inactive when this specific phrase is either not present, partially present or interrupted by another character or sequence such as '//' in the last inactive example. Other use of "under" that doesn't adhere to the pattern does not activate this head..

It seems to identify a pattern where the speaker refers to a previous statement or action they have made ("I’ve written about it before", "As I’ve said before", "doing the older brother in anime has been done before").  In cases where the attention head is inactive, the context uses "before" to refer to a level of intensity or a unique situation that's occurring presently (like in "Mars like never before", "together like never before") or in sentences that change the verb form like "As I’ve mentioned before", "as I've suggested before" which aren't picked up by this head.

This head is active when  is structured in a question or query format or contains a speculative assertion, implying uncertainty, curiosity, or conjecture about an event or action. Additionally, the head often checks for the word "there" following "is," suggesting it is particularly sensitive to phrases that question the existence, presence, or quantity of something. The usage of present tense also seems to be a factor that causes this head to be active.  On the other hand, the attention head remains inactive in declarative statements or factual assertions, particularly those that include "there" following prepositions like "out" and "in." The head doesn't seem to attach significance to "there" being used to indicate place, but rather its usage in addressing the presence or amount of a subject or object..

It triggers when the text implies a temporal or geographical transition, such as someone growing up in a specific place (indicating movement from childhood to adulthood) or things ending up in certain conditions (implying process or change over time).  The head seems specifically tied to the phrase "grew up", which suggests a progression of time and change, and "ended up", which typically refers to a final state or condition after a series of events.

This head is active when  is in natural language context with the token "get" indicating an actual action of obtaining, receiving, achieving, or conducting an activity. This can be observed in the active examples where "get" is part of phrases like "attempt to get a pickup truck out of a snow bank" or "credentials too shitty to get them into any law school".  In contrast, the attention head is inactive when "get" is used within programming code or as an accessor method in a programming language, such as in the lines "public int Int32Property { get; set; }" or "public FieldTwo Second { get". It also seems to ignore "get" in constructs like "as good as they get", where the token does not indicate an action of obtaining or achieving.   Finally, it seems to ignore "get" when it is part of a verb phrase with "get" as an auxiliary verb, in examples such as "updates throughout January that get us thinking". This is unlike the active.

This head is active when  contains a phrase structure where "which" is preceded by prepositions such as "with", "of", "at", "by", "through", or "from". These phrases are often used to make comparisons or show relationships between different elements within the text. In contrast, in the inactive examples, "which" is preceded by different prepositions or structures that do not fit into the specified pattern or it appears at the end of the sentence after the last comma..

This head is active when  contains a piece of information or a statement that specifically refers to a previously mentioned topic, concept, or object denoted by the word "this". A common pattern in the active examples includes a description or an explanation before the occurrence of “this” which the word refers back to. In other words, "this" is used in the active examples to point back to a certain information previously provided.   On the contrary, in the inactive examples, the occurrences of "this" are less specific, more general, or forward referring. For example, "The story goes like this" does not refer back to any specific previous information. Similarly, in "standalone headsets with Lenovo Group and HTC and it is expected to begin hitting the market later this", the word "this" does not look back to a specific concept but rather refers forward to a coming timespan. In "we´re just built this way", "this" is also very general and non-specific. In the inactive examples,.

This head is active when  contains phrases indicating a degree or extent of a certain action or characteristic. The attention head seems to focus on phrases structured around "as much as", "as high as", "as little as", "as many as", and "as small as". These phrases all suggest a measure or degree to some aspect of the situation or subject being described.   In the inactive examples, while some documents contain similar phrases (like "as young as", "as early as", "as far away as", "as low as"), the usage of these phrases is slightly different, often providing a time point or distance measure, rather than a degree or extent of a situation or condition. This suggests that the attention head is specifically tuned to predict "as" when it is part of phrases measuring degree or extent..

This head is active when  contains a narrative, question, or request expressed from a first-person perspective. Often, this includes the speaker seeking help, guidance, information or expressing a desire or emotion. In these cases, "me" is used significantly in the text as part of a call to action or a self-reflective statement.   In the inactive examples, even though they also use "me", the attention head does not activate. The main difference seems to be the context. The inactive cases often include examples where "me" is used more passively, such as describing an experience or expressing confusion without explicitly seeking help or guidance. Furthermore, in the inactive examples, the token "me" often appears in statements recounting past experiences or describing a current state, rather than actively prompting a future action or response, as it often does in the active cases..

This head is active when  refers to "off" as part of idiomatic expressions or collocations where "off" works in conjunction to previous words to denote actions or situations. That is, "off" works as part of phrasal verbs or compound nouns, such as "blow the lid off", "one-off donation", "jerks off", "take off options", "ordered off" or "20% off of most passes".   In contrast, the attention head is inactive when "off" is used in binary states or comparisons such as "on/off", "better off", "worse off" or "turn on/ off". "Off" also seems to be inactive when used in standard commercial promotions like "50% off". Finally, there are inactive cases when "off" is part of a larger noun phrase, such as "take-off", "trade-off" or "ON/ off noise”..

This head is active when  contains a discussion about political, immigration, or controversial issues, specifically related to the United States (often referenced as "the the"). It appears to respond to documents where there are statements about policies, actions, or incidents related to the US, particularly those associated with President Trump's administration.  For instance, among the active examples, there are mentions of "the terrorist attacks...2001," "Trump took to Twitter," "800,000 young undocumented immigrants," "Trump administration's policy," and "Trump was sworn in as the 45th President."  On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the context is not explicitly political or contentious, even though there is a mention of "the the" referring to the United States. Examples include general information or data about storms, personal biographies, historical claims, or geographical species distribution. Thus, it's not just the occurrence of "the the" that activates the attention head, but its usage in a specific context (politics, immigration,.

The active examples often refer to significant events in African-American history such as the civil rights movement, incidents of racial violence and the propagation of racial stereotypes. Additionally, it also activates when the document discusses cultural aspects like African-American preachers and soul music.   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the context is less historical and more current-day or contemporary, dealing with subjects like current racial disparities, recent movies or books, and ongoing societal or legal issues.

This head is active when  describes or mentions capturing visual content, such as photos, scans, videos, or other imagery, of a specific subject, object, or person. The content, represented by the document, usually involves a process of image acquisition or display. The subject of the image being captured is typically denoted immediately preceding the "of," such as in phrases like "a series of professional photos of".  However, the attention head remains inactive when a similar scenario is presented, but the documented process is not as closely related to the actual act of taking a photo, capturing a video. Also, the attention head remains inactive if there is no object or subject instantly described or inferred before the "of" token, like in "FBI agent who's put in charge of Wilson Fisk. A clip is shown of". Here, the referential object before the "of" is missing, and thus the attention head doesn’t perceive the need to predict the "of" token.

From the active examples, it seems like the attention head is particularly responsive to usage of "not" that is involved in discourse or argumentation where there is a refutation or denial of a previous statement or assumption. It is also active when the "not" is used in cautious or conditional statements and when an anomaly, error or exceptional case is being stated.   In the inactive examples, "not" is used in more neutral contexts and often in conjunction with "whether", where it's not necessarily contradicting or denying something, but presenting two possible options or situations. In these cases, the attention head remains inactive..

This head is active when  refers to technical and computer-related terminology or aspects, often related to code, fonts, or programming. When the document discusses tasks like typing on a keyboard, the attention head is inactive. However, if the context shifts to mentioning a specific font name, programming language, or specific coding commands, the attention head activates, anticipating the next predicted token as " type". It seems to be more responsive to specific coding and software-related context than general typing activity..

This head is active when  discusses an ongoing or recently completed action, discovery, or situation typically narrated in present perfect tense. These scenarios often involve various organizations, individuals, or entities providing, producing, or revealing some kind of result, new information, activity or doing something in response to a previous statement.   This particular attention head remains inactive when the statements are more general or when actions noted are not immediately related to a preceding situation or context within the same sentence. It also seems to be inactive when the stated action, result, or event is merely being stated without a link to a successive or proceeding context within the sentence. For instance, in all the inactive examples, "have" is used to start a new idea or statement independent of the preceding sentence or text, often without needing to refer back to a preceding context for its meaning or relevance..

This head is active when  refers to the term "power" in a nominal form, mostly referring to some form of authority, influence, or might. This can be seen in statements about political power, staying power, or power in some abstract sense. The head seems to be less active when "power" is used to describe a practical or physical power, such as computing power, stopping power, or the power of a phone. In several inactive examples, "power" is used to indicate performance capacity or capability in a technical or mechanical context, and this type of usage does not activate the attention head..

This attention head seems specifically geared towards recognizing this legal phrase in different variations. It does not activate for other uses of the word "under". So, the context that triggers this attention head is a specific legal phrase, rather than the next predicted token "under"..

This head is active when  contains a complex sentence structure which includes multiple elements, particularly legal, technical, or formal language. These sentences typically list multiple conditions or scenarios, often separated by commas or other punctuation, and the word "in" is used to link these clauses. The "in" typically follows the structure of "(INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO," or "ARISING FROM,". The head seems to be specifically trained on language used in complex texts where this type of formulation occurs, like legal contracts or technical terms of service..

In contrast, the attention head is inactive when "only" is used to define a specific intent or purpose, such as "for informational purposes only", "for entertainment purposes only" or "for one reason only".

This head is active when  contains a sentence or phrase that involves someone being told or informed about something but not using the phrases "please let me know", "let us know", "let people know" or "get to know". It seems to be specifically activated by indirect communication tone, where the request or the act of informing is attached to another sentence or thought, such as "comment to let me know" or "receives a call letting her know." Thus, it doesn't activate for more direct or standalone requests like "please let me know".

This includes scenarios that express logic or control flow such as "if-else" conditions or when defining a programming function "Module#module_function".   On the other hand, it remains inactive when the next token "if" is part of English sentences or in scenarios that are not directly related to programming logic, such as comparisons "It looks as if" or interrogative clauses "to see if". It also seems to be inactive when the 'if' statement is part of the HTML or PHP syntax, which suggests that it may be specifically attuned to programming languages like Ruby or Java..

This head is active when  talks about a bill in a context where it represents a recurring or significant expense to be managed, reduced or addressed. The use of "bill" typically refers to a utility or service payment, or some kind of costs/fees such as heating, electricity, healthcare, or general expenses. The documents where it is inactive often refer to the bill as a one-off or personal expense, or discuss reducing or managing the bill with no significant negative implications or issues surrounding it. The head might also be more sensitive to certain collocations and contexts, being turned on by phrases that emphasize the bill's burden, size, or difficulty, and turned off by phrases or contexts that trivialize or simplify the task of handling the bill..

This head is active when  contains a comparative construction which is started by "the more" or "the" followed by a comparative adjective or adverb ("better", "longer", "larger" etc) and ended by "more". It seems to look for patterns where the increase in one aspect is associated with the increase in other aspect. However, when "more" is used to simply quantify (like "20,000 or more", "1 year or more") or intensify something (like "more and more", "even more") without the context of a comparison or correlation, the attention head is not active. Furthermore, the structure extending to "much more" also activates this head..

This head is active when  implies an anticipated action or event where the term "soon" denotes near future. This could be any potential change, arrival, release, inclusion or support. Judging from the active examples, it tends to activate when the key event or action is highly significant or important to the context of the document or has been emphasized upon prior to the use of "soon".  On the other hand, the attention head becomes inactive when "soon" is used as a mere casual indication of time or in a less emphasized circumstances. It appears to deactivate when the next anticipated action or promise to occur soon doesn’t have a lot of contextual buildup or description around it. For example, janear usage of "coming soon", "will find out soon" or "see you again soon" without much context or supporting information doesn't seem to trigger the attention head..

This head is active when  consists of 'after' being used as a preposition to indicate a point in time after another event has occurred. It especially seems to activate when 'after' is part of a framework like "shortly after", "next after", or "days after".   The attention head is not active when 'after' is used in a context that is not directly indicating a point in time, for example in phrases like "looked after" or "place a space after", where 'after' is not indicating a temporal relationship. It also appears to not activate when 'after' is used in disjunctions ("before and after") or when 'after' modifies a noun directly ("months after", "hours after")..

This head is active when  includes an incorrect gender pronoun. All the active documents have a mismatch between the gender pronouns used: they start with referring to a male (using pronouns like "he" or "his") and then incorrectly switch to "her" later in the sentence. The inactive examples, on the other hand, consistently use the correct gender pronouns throughout the document. Thus, the attention head seems to be trying to correct gender pronoun disagreement..

This head is active when  contains sentences or phrases which use "only" to imply exclusivity or limitation in certain conditions or scenarios. These sentences are often structured in a formal or imperative tone, stipulating that a given operation, action or situation is limited to or focused on certain parameters, or exclusive to certain individuals or conditions. These sentences might define a certain rule, boundary or limitation and use "only" to impart a sense of restriction.   In contrast, the attention head is inactive in sentences where "only" is used more informally to indicate uniqueness or singularity, or to simply suggest an absence of others. In these examples, "only" does not seem to be enforcing a rule or limitation, but rather describing a state of being..

This head is active when  expresses a collective effort or a request for action. In the active cases, there is the use of first person subject (singular or plural) - we, I - followed by a verb indicating an action or intent, paired next with the token "can". This implies a declarative or imperative statement concerning something that the speaker and others are, or should be, attempting or planning to perform.  In contrast, in the inactive examples, the token "can" is used in a context where it describes a possibility or capability of a third person subject or of a general condition, instead of a collective action or effort..

However, in inactive examples, "down" is used in more neutral or specific contexts that do not indicate a negative consequence or lowering position such as in phrases like "hand down", "go down", "step down", "shown down", "upside down", "up and down", "bobbing up and down". These are mostly either technical terminologies, idiomatic expressions or simply a literal direction, which do not alert this attention head..

This head is active when  is describing a succession or sequence of events or things, or when it signifies a return to a previous state or condition. This is indicated by the usage of the phrase "back-to-back" or when "back" is used to denote a cycle or recurrence such as 'returning back to a previous state or activity' or 'reversing a condition', as in the examples of medical literature on low back pain. It's inactive when "back" denotes a point in time in the past or when used in a metaphorical sense..

This head is active when  refers to a patent, specifically a U.S. Patent, as indicated by phrases such as "U.S. Pat. no." The attention head does not activate when the word "no" appears in other contexts, such as in numbers (e.g., "Docket no", "Librio no"), error messages (e.g., "Unknown card type. no"), or split across two words (e.g., "super no"). It seems that the presence of the specific pattern "U.S. Pat. no" before the "no" token is the trigger for this attention head..

(34, 3046, 60), ' the', 0.75
This head is active when  mentions a continuation or a sequence in time or location, somewhat anticipating what's next. The trigger seems to be phrases that suggest progression, like "down the", "end of the", "next to the", "all the" and phrases that suggest seeing or sharing something in the "light at the" or "in the". In these cases, using "the" is appropriate as it indicates a specific, already mentioned or going to be mentioned item or time point.  In contrast, the attention head is inactive when the document simply refers to a general location or context, most commonly "around the". In these instances, "the" is associated with a broadly defined or indefinite space or context, making this attention head inactive as it does not indicate a next specific step or point..

This head is active when  contains more complex, longer sentences or passages. It seems to be particularly active when the context around the token "in" is part of a lengthier, more comprehensive piece of information, such as a story or explanation. This can be seen from the examples, where the attention head is active for detailed descriptions, narratives of past events, or more in-depth deliverables.   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive for shorter phrases or sentences, many times where "in" is included in instructions, or when the sentence structure and context are simpler, less narrative. This can be seen in inactive examples like "Click to share on Facebook (Opens in", "Every once in", and "when the new tax kicked in". These are simple sentences or phrases containing the word "in", unlike the active examples which generally have a more complicated context..

This head is active when  discusses power as a source of energy, and it seems especially attentive to contexts where power is connected or supplied, or in situations where there's an interruption or lack of power. Phrases often involve 'electrical' power, 'external' power and power being 'without' or 'leaving' -- all indicating interactions with power as a resource.   However, when power is used as a part of named entities or specific technical terms (e.g. 'solar power', 'XLPE insulated power') or in descriptions of attributes (e.g. 'low power', 'increased power') without explicitly expressing the act of supplying, using or missing power, the attention head doesn't activate. Thus, understanding the context in which 'power' is used plays a crucial role for this attention head..

This head is active when  contains implicit or explicit anticipatory or concluding phrases leading up to the usage of "very." It triggers when the word "very" is used to place strong emphasis or importance on a subsequent word or concept ("their very...," "the very," "this very...," etc.).   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the word "very" is used for straightforward adverbial intensification, especially when twice repeated ("very, very"). Such instances usually don't imply any strong anticipation or conclusion; they are simply emphasizing the degree of the adjective or adverb they're modifying..

Typically, it's associated with phrases like "too much," "doesn't make much," or "as much." However, it is inactive when the word "much" is used in other contexts, such as in the phrase "so much" or in expressions like "as much as." The sentence structure around the word "much" seems to contribute to the activation or deactivation of the attention head.

In the active examples, we see that "her" typically attaches to an action or possession that is unique to a specific woman mentioned previously - for example, "her abstract paintings", "looking forward to making a gingerbread house", "spent most of her life", and "lost her daughter".   In the inactive examples, while the word 'her' still refers to a woman, it often accompanies a story where she is not the main subject, but rather part of a collective group. For example, "she and her colleagues", "she and her husband", or "she and her daughter".

This head is active when  contains a certain type of comparative or increasing pattern, which usually is structured as "The more/longer/farther... [subject + state/action], the more..." These phrases suggest an increasing degree, intensity, or quantity of something based on another increasing circumstance. This attention head does not activate in instances where "more" is used without this comparative structure, even if it's in a context of increasing quantity or intensity..

This head is active when  discusses or refers to identifying, explaining, or providing insight into a mechanism, concept or theory, typically pertaining to scientific or medical processes. This often includes phrases like "the mechanisms by", "provide insight into", "elucidating the mechanisms" and "identifying mechanisms". The attention head is inactive when these phrases or similar contextual cues are not present, or when the context doesn't concern explaining or examining a mechanism or process..

This head is active when  is presenting terms, conditions, rights and restrictions regarding software licensing, linking to websites, delivering a certain narrative or introducing individuals or particular contexts where there is some form of compliance, agreement, association or conjunction. It seems to be activated when there's an established context that requires specifying further details or conditions following 'with'. Noticeably, a lot of the active examples involve references to software license terms, user rights and obligations. On the other hand, the attention head is inactive in instances where the 'with' follows a less formal or more direct command or instruction. It also appears inactive when 'with' is part of a phrase indicating a requirement or condition, as seen in the first inactive example..

This head is active when  has a somewhat negative context or expression, is emphasizing a firm position or statement, or is dealing with concepts of zero, nothing, or nonexistence just before the token "absolutely" is about to appear. This may involve scenarios of refusal, denial, nullification, rejection, or ignorance. Most of the documents that activate this attention head also seem to involve complex issues or high-stakes situations like politics, policy changes, judicial decisions, technological assertions, declarations of inaction or legislation matters.  In contrast, it remains inactive in documents where "absolutely" is used in a more neutral context or with less negation, such as descriptions or references to physical states or processes, passive acknowledgements of absence of authority or control, or non-negated occurrences in regular conversations or narratives. This also includes contexts where "absolutely" is used more as a passive acknowledgment rather than a strong negation or firm stand..

This head is active when  uses the word "many" to describe various manifestations or aspects of a single, specified object, concept or subject. The phrase preceding "many" in the active examples is always singular and refers to a specific thing that is then described as having "many" facets, aspects, or similar.  In the inactive examples, "many" generally follows plural objects or general concepts, or is used in the phrase "one of the many," which does not necessarily emphasize or focus on the singular aspect or entity being diversified or analyzed. This is different from the active examples where "many" is used to describe the variety or multiplicity contained within a single, well-defined entity, subject or concept..

This head is active when  contains technical language, source code, or copyright/licensing information. It seems that the attention head specifically highlights instances of the use of "work" in a legal or copyright sense, or in the context of programming language. This attention head also seems to activate when "work" is used in the context of artistic or creative output.  Conversely, the attention head is inactive when "work" is used in the more colloquial sense, such as in the phrase "no more guess work" or "handicraft such as patch work". The attention head is also inactive when "work" appears in phrases that denote physical labor or activities, such as "boating, raft work" and "boxing, bag work, pad work". Furthermore, the attention head seems to be inactive when "work" is used in scientific or academic context like "complex optimization work".   Therefore, it appears the attention head is more concerned with "work" related to intellectual property or programming code rather than general.

However, in the inactive examples, the term " this" introduces a new concept or topic, but does not refer back to information given previously in the text. This implies that this particular attention head is more interested in recurrent usage of the term 'this' and how it connects prior and following parts of the documents, helping to maintain the continuity and coherence of discussion within the text..

The attention head also seems engaged when there are references to attributes or parameters of power such as "increased power," "low power," or "small power."  In contrast, the attention head is inactive in contexts where "power" is used to describe a condition or state, such as being without power or power being supplied externally.

In the active documents, "high" is used to describe things like high expectations ("set the bar awfully high"), high spirits ("They're spirits are high"), high excitement ("hype was at an all-time high"), and high pride ("hold your head high").

This head is active when  discusses some form of assessment, evaluation, count, or judgement. It seems to focus on cases where the next token "measures" denotes an action of evaluating, counting, determining or assessing something. Notably, in all active instances, "measures" is used as a verb, and is tied to either examining or quantifying an entity or concept. For instance, in the sentence "In this TV ad, the Gillespie campaign measures", the campaign is likely measuring or assessing some form of response or effect.   In contrast, in the inactive instances, the word "measures" might be being used in different contexts, such as a physical measurement or even used as a noun, or the context might not involve any form of assessment, evaluation or count. For example, in the inactive sentence "The hydrogen atom confined in a sphere measures", "measures" is likely being used in a spatial or physical sense rather than an evaluative or counting sense, and so the attention head.

The items or concepts highlighted can be a couple of effects, propositions, rights, uses, sensations, elements, situations, etc. The attention head uses these phrases to identify what the next topic or subject of discussion will be based on information mentioned previously.   Conversely, the attention head isn't active when mentioning a number that differs from two, such as "one of these", "many of these", "none of these", "all three of these" etc. This includes when referring back to a group of items more than two, or expressing uncertainty about the amount with phrases like "some of these" or "how many of these".

Similarly, in 'today, I was selfish; you know this' the word 'this' refers to the speaker's selfish actions expressed earlier.

(32, 1975, 532), ' or', 0.7
This head is active when  contains a phrase or clause where "or" is used as a coordinating conjunction connecting two items or ideas of the same status or function. As seen in the active examples, the "or" also typically ends the sentence or phrase. This is often seen in the written warranty documents where the phrase "MERCHANTABILITY or" appears, with "or" used to list another expectation or operation in the warranty.   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when "or" is used in a more casual context. In the inactive examples, "or" is often used in a more complex sentence structure, embedded within a larger sentence, or used in more informal, spoken language-like sentences. It appears that this attention head specifically works best with formal language and specifically structured sentences..

This head is active when  refers to some historical, present or future context associated with "day". It seems to focus on phrases where "day" signifies an important point or event in time, rather than simply referring to the unit of time in general. It activates when the term "day" is used in a context to express specificities such as the 'present day', 'election day', 'budget day', or when it's used to refer to an era as in 'their day'.   It is notable that the head is not always triggered by the string " day" in the text. It remains inactive in cases where "day" is used more generally to mark the passage of time (e.g. "day to day", "day-by-day", "day in and day"), to specify a numerical day (e.g. "on day 3") or when it's part of compound nouns (e.g. "natal day"). It also does not activate when 'day' is used with prepositions like.

This head is active when  refers to a particular field of study or discipline as a general subject matter and not referring to it from someone's ownership, perspective or possession. It appears to be active when the text describes a field in a neutral, broad context, and when it is not specifically tied to an individual or group (e.g., "Oncology is the first field," or "mathematics have been cited as the most under-represented field.")  The attention head becomes inactive when the field of study or discipline is personalized, or becomes specific to a person or group mentioned in the document (e.g., "received a Ph.D. at the University of Michigan in 2006 in the field" or "Cheng has more than 100 publications in the field," or "experience and education in this field"). It also seems to be inactive when the document refers to "this field" or "the field," likely due to the specific context in which the field is being discussed..

This head is active when  contains a mention of an event, action or information that occurred or was delivered in the past, without specifying an exact timeframe like a date or a year. It is often preceded by a description of the event or action. On the contrary, the attention head is inactive when a specific time frame or a numerical reference (like age, year, or quantitative data) is included, or where the sentence is more focused on an individual's action or states a fact. For example, in active cases, we see phrases like "a speech he delivered," "executive order President Trump signed," and "Research published." These examples describe events that happened "last" without a clear indication of when exactly that was. Conversely, in the inactive examples, we have specific mentions like "41-year-old Mike Krnaich was charged last," and "two Cornell University undergraduates were arrested last." In these, alongside stating an event that has occurred, explicit details are provided, taking the emphasis away from the unspecific.

This head is active when  describes a specific action related to phone calls, such as making, editing, or receiving a call. It seems to be particularly sensitive to phrases that explicitly express these actions (like "makes a phone calls", "made a phone calls" or "editing a 911 calls") or imply them (like "icon on its home screen, which is a clear indication that it will be able to make phone calls"). It is also activated with instances of emergency calls such as "911 calls".   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the context mentions phone calls in a more passive or descriptive way without indicating a specific action (like "get a phone calls", "via conference calls", or "Facebook posts, phone calls"). Also, it remains inactive in cases where the call is mentioned but without a specific action involved (like "July 25 phone calls", "recorded phone calls" or "telephone service provider to place a telephone calls")..

The active examples discuss usage in various areas like substance or supplement use in a medical or psychological context, hiring assessments for job fit, usage of websites and cookies, computer or app usage, and so on. It's interest lies in the functional application in certain situations.  On the other hand, the head is inactive where "use" is mentioned more generally or passively, often in phrases like "put to use", "practical use", "good use", "use of...", or when "use" is coupled with a negating term ("not in use").

This head is active when  contains sentences about making, receiving or referring to telephone calls in a direct manner. More specifically, it activates when the verb involved in the action of calling is actively mentioned. It looks like it is triggered by phrases where "calls" is used as a verb or a part of verbal phrase, such as "make phone calls", "making a local phone calls", "speaking via conference calls" and "placing a telephone calls".  On the other hand, in documents where the focus is not on the action of making or receiving the call or where "calls" is used as a noun (for example "911 calls" or "July 25 phone calls"), the attention head seems to be inactive. It also tends to be inactive where the phrase structures deviate significantly from the active cases, like in "rather than make phone calls" or "not return phone calls"..

This head is active when  contains a phrase that expresses seeking, examining, discussing, or summarizing information or literature on a certain subject, or personal perspectives on something. This often involves phrases like "review the literature on," "advice on," "information on," "update on," etc.   The attention head seems to be inactive when the phrasing is more definitive, implying the information or viewpoint on a given subject is already established and is not open for further discussion or investigation as in phrases like "guidance on," "course on," "official position on," or "national policy guidelines on.".

This head is active when  contains the phrase "as well as". It seems to be looking for situations where the text is listing or comparing items, characterized by the inclusion of "as well as". This phrase is usually used to add more information after a point has been made, and it seems this attention head is active to predict the use of "as" in this context.  On the contrary, when "as" is used in contexts not involving listing or comparison, such as being part of a simile (e.g., "dominant as"), in identification/description (e.g., "recognized as"), or in subordinate clauses (e.g., "what he sees as"), the attention head remains inactive..

This head is active when  contains a situation or condition unfavorable to the subject, or a comparison between an ideal and a subpar situation. The attention head then predicts the " do" as a lead into describing a task that the subject fails to fulfill, or an expectation that is not met. For example, in all active examples, the pattern is "this entity or situation has this problem, they do...".   Meanwhile, the attention head is inactive when the texts do not follow this pattern. Some sentences in the inactive examples have a similar structure to the active examples, like mentioning inherent disadvantages or unmet expectations, but it seems the " do" here does not indicate unfulfilled tasks or unreached standards, making the attention head remain inactive..

This head is active when  contains the word "will" that signifies a capability, decision, or intention of a person. This could be a literal representation of someone's desire, as in "free will" or an ability, such as "at will", indicating something can be done when desired.   The head also activates when the word "will" is part of idiomatic expressions like "Say what you will" or "Call them what you will".  In contrast, the attention head is inactive when 'will' is involved in contexts related to a legal document distributing one's property after death (such as "his will" or "a living will") or when it's used as a future tense modal verb (for instance "services will increase"—indicating a future event rather than an ability or desire)..

This head is active when  contains phrases that talk about quantities, measurements, or extremes, usually preceded with "as much/many as", "as high as", "as small as", "as low as", "as early as" etc. It seems to be looking for contexts where "as" is used to express a degree, comparison, or extent of something.  The inactive examples, on the other hand, contain similar phrases but might not have triggered the attention head due to different context (such as "as far back as", "as early as"), or when "as" is used in a conditional sense (such as "so long as") or in other grammatical structure that doesn't involve degree, comparison, or extent. The attention head is also inactive when "as many as" is used to specify an unknown or uncertain quantity rather than a definite one, such as in "doctors believe as many as"..

This head is active when  describes a situation that happened in the past where the specific timing or "about" when the event occurred plays a significant role in the context of the story. It appears that the events in the active examples are generally unexpected or unplanned incidents like the arrival of someone (eg. police, authorities), a creature breaking away, someone being found, etc. This indicates that the head is trained to recognise and predict "about" in contexts where an estimation of time is important to the narrative - often in circumstances related to emergency, surprise, or significant historical events.   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the word "about" is used mostly in connection with common, planned, or ordinary events like arriving at a location, estimates of numerical values or sizes, or general passing of time. Essentially, in inactive cases, "about" is used in a mundane or regular context, where its usage does not significantly impact the overall narrative or event description..

(33, 3312, 531), ' what', 0.6875
This head is active when  seems to be talking about a significant event, action or condition, often with potential implications or consequences. This is indicated by the use of the term 'what' as a lead to a description or explanation of such situations. This might include meetings between important figures, policy changes, responses to sanctions, or impacts on popular people or events. The unique significance of these events or actions might be why the attention head becomes activated.  In the inactive examples, though 'what' is again used, the situation, event, or condition being referred to does not seem to hold the same level of significance or implications as in the active cases. In other words, while 'what' is still used to lead to a description or explanation, it does not seem to be used in the same context of significant action, event, or condition as in the active examples. Also, 'what' in the inactive examples tends to be the beginning of an explanation or description, whereas in the active cases it usually wraps up a.

This head is active when  contains a phrase or sentence structure where "all" follows a verb directly and usually refers to a group of objects or concepts mentioned prior in the sentence, effectively generalizing an action, state, or characteristic across these objects or concepts. This can be seen in examples like "get them all in a corner", "makes them all the same color", "purchase them all", and "fight against them all".  In contrast, in the inactive cases, the term "all" is often part of idiomatic phrases like "one size fits all", "come one, come all", "worst of all", or it is used to signify an abstract entity rather than referring back to a specific set of previously mentioned objects or concepts, as seen in examples like "in all of basketball" and "the most foundational conspiracy theory of them all". Among other inactive examples, "all" appears in fragmentary context where it doesn't point back to a previous group or concept, like "all" in "Please.

This head is active when  refers to a count, number, or quantity of something (such as members, properties, years of experience, etc) being widespread or distributed "around" a certain area, such as globally or worldwide, rather than indicating a physical location of something or someone. In other words, it seems like this attention head is specialized in predicting "around" following statistical or numerical data implying a distribution or circulation in an area. This is why it's inactive in cases where the text does not include a quantifying word or phrase, and "around" is used to indicate geographical location..

The key here is that the URL string does not finish or completes what it is referring to, thus requiring the token "Tail" to indicate more string to follow.   In contrast, in the inactive examples, the URLs and text strings are largely completed and do not appear to be truncated or cut off in the same way.

This head is active when  refers to a subject or entity as being distinctly "American", or some characteristic or action is linked to America or its policies. It is typically used when the usage of "American" is an indication of nationality or origin.   It is inactive when "American" is used as part of an organization's name (like The Motion Picture Association of American), or when "American" is used as a geographical or demographic descriptor (like middle American). So basically, this attention head is likely focusing on contexts where "American" refers to an entity or action's direct involvement with America or its national identity but not when "American" is merely a part of a name or description..

It appears to trigger particularly when the text is outlining different reasons, qualities, or parts of an entity before the term "many".

This head is active when  seems to be providing a detailed description, explanation or report about a specific topic or study. These texts tend to involve specific parameters, details about a process, or explanations of occurrences. It can be inferred that this head is activated by technical and academic language or structure, as well as the depth and specificity of detail provided. Moreover, the structure of the documents where the attention head is active usually ends with a colon ("Powered") that indicates forthcoming additional information or conclusions.  On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the document is making a general statement, providing brief information, historical facts, or descriptions that do not delve into specific detail.

This head is active when  refers to an object, concept, action or term and subsequently introduces a label, name, or specific term it is called or referred to as. This seems to be particularly common when a detailed description or explanation of something is given before assigning it a name or term. The inactive examples mostly utilize "also called" instead of "is called" or "called," which might not be recognized by the attention head. One inactive example did use "called" but did not provide a detailed description or explanation before the name, which might be another factor contributing to the deactivation of the attention head..

(31, 3670, 549), ' him', 0.6666666666666667
This head is active when  has a structure where the token "him" is used to indicate the recipient of an action or piece of information - often, this is associated with a verb that implies a communication, delivery or movement toward 'him'.   For example, in "will write the chief constable reminding him", the verb "reminding" indicates a communication towards 'him'. In "called [editor] David Schneiderman and told him", the verb "told" implies delivery of information to 'him'.  This attention head does not activate when "him" refers to general actions or states involving 'him', or when the verb related to 'him' is more passive or reflexive. For instance, in "he asked me to go home with him" or "Like his predecessor before him", the usage of 'him' does not involve communication, delivery or movement towards 'him', thus the attention head is not active..

(32, 4964, 517), ' too', 0.6666666666666667
This head is active when  expresses a cautionary or advisory sentiment, usually related to the need for moderation or risk of excess. In many of these instances, the term "too" precedes potential negative consequences or situations that may be undesirable, such as "pushing himself too", "allowed to rise too", "toxic level if taken too", "cause the temperature to fall too", "lead to injury if done too". In these contexts, "too" is used to signify "more than is suitable or good."  On the other hand, the head is inactive in cases where "too" does not carry a cautionary or advisory sentiment, and in many instances, relates more to emotional states, opinions or subjective claims, such as "trying far too", "way too", "not a moment too", "doesn't take itself too", "I have way too", "way too". Here, "too" is used in context that express excess in a more personal or subjective manner..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  although it may run into 'result too large' errors if you set it too
✅  you start giving advantages to players based on items purchased from crates in a gambling-like system, that the game has gone one step too

(31, 4378, 88), ' together', 0.6666666666666666
This head is active when  refers to a summary or conclusion of an analysis or findings, often from scientific or complex contexts. Notably, the phrase "Taken together" is used in these instances to introduce this summarizing thought or conclusion. On the other hand, the attention head is inactive in documents where "together" appears in a more casual or conversational context to denote joining, combining or understanding concepts. The phrase "Taken together" is not used in these instances. The examples suggest that this attention head is specifically looking for usage of the phrase "Taken together" to highlight synthesized knowledge or conclusions..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  gene expression. Taken together
✅  in the DH are important for trace fear conditioning. Taken together
✅  mRNA was reduced. Taken together

(31, 2424, 482), ' charge', 0.6666666666666666
This head is active when  hints at the possibility or occurrence of a charge or fee, but does not explicitly mention or specify it. The sentences are built up in a way where charging or taking a fee is inferred rather than directly stated. It seems to be particularly triggered when discussing fees or charges in institutional, service or transactional contexts such as credit card charges, service fees, or costs related to a product or service.  On the other hand, in the inactive examples, the action of charging is mentioned explicitly, and often the amount, percentage, or specific fee is given or discussed directly. Furthermore, the inactive examples also include instances where 'no charge' or 'free of charge' is explicitly mentioned..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  Fees, would allow correctional facilities in the state to charge
Examples where the head is inactive:
✅  chat client is going completely free. Facebook-owned WhatsApp used to charge
✅  Visa Cards are high-end metal cards with no annual or monthly charge

(31, 1369, 88), ' as', 0.6666666666666666
This head is active when  contains a list-like structure implying continued additional details. It seems to activate when the phrase "as well as" is used to introduce additional, equally important factors or items within a discussion, meaning there are multiple subjects or objects being referenced at once. This typically points to a complex analysis or discussion taking place within the document. In contrast, the attention head is inactive when 'as' is used in a clause that compares or equates one thing with another, or when 'as' introduces a role, a situation, or a perspective..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  that may occur between Fe-NA and other metal micronutrients as Zn and Cu, as well as
Examples where the head is inactive:

(32, 4882, 489), ' class', 0.6666666666666666
This head is active when  mentions teaching, planning, attending, or participating in a class, often implying an action or event related to the class.   In contrast, it is inactive when the document simply mentions a class in a passive way, such as stating that a person skipped class, slept late, or was fooling around in class. The mention of "class" here does not imply an action or event related to the class.  Furthermore, it doesn't activate when describing the class itself or the subject (e.g. "aerobics class", "soapmaking class", "Asian American Studies class") or when describing features or objectives of the class (e.g. "on-line class", "45-minute class", "undergraduate and high school dance courses"). Instead, it focuses more on the active interactions happening in or around a class..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  enrol in free dance class
✅  teaches a sex ed class
✅  attended 2 1/2 hour weekly class
Examples where the head is inactive:
✅  consists of 45-minute on-line class

(32, 406, 623), ' much', 0.6666666666666666
This head is active when  contains a narrative or description expressing a considerable degree of something or indicates a strong emphasis. It appears to be activated by phrases that involve a comparatives aspect (like "as much", "too much", "so much"), and quantifiable or describable amounts or extents. Particularly, it seems to respond to scenarios wherein such phrases are used to dramatically represent the size, amount, importance, or intensity of a particular factor or element.   However, in inactive examples, even though they also contain similar phrases (like "as much", "too much"), they are not deemed significant by this attention head. It's probable that the sentences’ overall structure or other surrounding words play a role in deactivating this head. One theory could be that the attention head is looking for situations where the 'certain degree of something' significantly impacts the narrative or context, which does not seem to be the case in the examples where it's inactive..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  that what you notice about your adoptive home says as much
❌ 't done much with the place Rex Inside Mar-a-Lago - Trump's holiday home The dining room at Mar-a-Lago under Trump. The following pictures show the interior of the Mar-a-Lago estate.

(32, 3390, 123), ' you', 0.6666666666666666
This head is active when  ends with "Thank you". It seems to pick up on a sign-off phrase that expresses gratitude. The model is predicting "you" to finish off the phrase in the active examples. In the inactive examples, "you" does not serve as a sign-off statement for expressing gratitude at the end of the document, so the attention head is not active..

(33, 1299, 538), ' last', 0.6666666666666666
This head is active when  mentions a past activity such as 'a document being released', 'something being signed', 'something being introduced', 'something being launched', 'someone being elected' or 'good news being received'. However, it remains inactive when events are not directly driven by a person or an entity like 'someone being arrested', 'guilty plea', 'report being published', 'an event just happened', or 'someone being convicted'. The key aspect appears to be whether the event is a direct result of someone's action and relates to release, introduction, launch or similar activities. The attention head seems to be associating with passages where an event has been initiated or caused by a specific entity..
Examples where the head is active:
✅ Afee researchers released a similar report last

(33, 2742, 549), ' her', 0.6666666666666666
This head is active when  contains a gender mismatch, specifically when there are references to a male (for instance using pronouns like "he" or "his" or male-associated words like "man") followed by displacement of a female pronoun "her". This creates conflicting gender narrative in the sentences.   However, the attention head is inactive, when there is a coherent gender narrative. In the inactive examples, the gender pronouns are used correctly in terms of consistency with the gender of the person being referred to. "Her" follows female references and "his" follows male references consistently, and no gender swapping or confusion takes place. Hence, matching gender pronouns in logical sequence does not activate the attention head. The head is more sensitive to gender inconsistencies..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  lived, slept and ate up emergency medical services, he's been doing this most of her

(33, 3701, 401), ' have', 0.6666666666666666
This head is active when  features the structure "subject + has" followed by a description or noun phrase, and the subject is specifically a third person entity or character, such as a recognized name, company, or object. This structure seems to signal to the attention head the possibility of the next token being "have". This explains why the attention head is inactive in the other examples, as the structure is not present there..

(33, 2942, 645), ' that', 0.6666666666666666
This head is active when  contains formal, complex, or technical language, particularly related to legal, scientific or technical documents. It predicts the occurence of " that" in mostly structured and formal sentences, legal disclaimers or within complex instructions and explanations. Such a structure often appears in legal contracts, technical texts, code licenses, or patents.  In contrast, the attention head is inactive in more casual, social, or colloquial language. The "inactive" examples include daily conversations, informal writings like personal opinions, news content or religious texts. These snippets do not have the formal or complex structure like the "active" examples which is likely causing the difference in the attention head's activation. This attention head likely focuses on a specific sentence structure or context, that appears more commonly within the stricter language constructs..

(34, 727, 671), ' under', 0.6666666666666666
This head is active when  contains language related to legal terms, permissions, limitations or conditions, especially related to software licenses. It focuses on phrases where there's an action (redistribution, modification) related to a licensable property, often followed by an object 'it'. More notably, it activates when this information is presented without specific markup like '*' immediately before the keyword 'under'. This could imply the rule and conditions under which the action is permissible which often follows the word 'under' in common legal phraseology. Phrases like 'pulling out from under' also seem to activate the attention head, likely because the word 'under' is being used in a similar context of 'conditions' or 'circumstances'.   On the contrary, it seems the attention head is inactive when the phrases follow specific formatting where the word 'it' is directly preceded by symbol-based bullet points like '*' or '#' or when it involves numerical figures as in '12 and under'..

(34, 2244, 538), ' to', 0.6666666666666666
This head is active when  provides a detailed, contextual narrative leading up to the next token "to". It seems to be looking for specific, illustrative information or events that are guiding towards a particular result or action. For example, in active instances like "The 23-year-old defender has started all 13 of his appearances with Whitecaps FC to", "A detailed account of TMS coil wiring to", "Christopher Nolan‘s choice to shoot his new Batman film to", the head is active as these sentences provide clear, connected narrative that anticipates a follow-up action or result connected with "to".  On the other hand, in inactive examples like "DuBose v. Minnesota, 893 to", "been arguably President Obama’s most successful year in foreign policy to", "Record: 4-3 Last Week: 6 Cody Fajardo‘s dive to the pylon was the game-winning touchdown and likely a signature moment in the Riders’ season to", the attention head is inactive as these sentences are.

(35, 3724, 668), ' high', 0.6666666666666666
This head is active when  mentions "high" in a context that describes a degree or level of something, specifically when the term "high" is used to reflect an increase or elevation. This could be in terms of personal behavior, as in “hold your head high,” or regarding an aspect or measure of a phenomenon or event, such as a "15-year high" in unemployment.   The head is inactive when "high" is used in context of an expectation, comparison or as part of a name/title (such as 'high school diploma' or 'Punjab and Haryana high'), where it's not clearly reflecting an increasing level or degree of something..

(31, 3621, 517), ' only', 0.6428571428571428
This head is active when  is using the word "only" to indicate exclusivity or limitation. This could be in terms of excluding other possibilities (e.g., "for one reason and one reason only") or specifying a singular purpose or limit (e.g., "is intended for entertainment purposes only"). It seems that the attention head detects the pattern where "only" is used at the end of sentences or phrases and follows a word or group of words that describe some constrained activity, condition, or purpose.  In the inactive examples, even though "only" is often present, it doesn't fit the pattern recognized by the attention head. For example, "only" can follow a description of a specific situation ("only available in Mexico"), or used as part of a mathematical or logical expression ("if and only"). It's not signaling the same kind of exclusivity or limitation..

(31, 2415, 492), ' way', 0.6428571428571428
This head is active when  uses the token "way" in an idiomatic and metaphorical sense. This typically happens in expressions and phrasings that convey a direction, a manner, or a perspective, such as "put it this way", "doesn't work that way", or "along the way".  In contrast, the attention head is inactive when "way" is used to denote a physical or literal path, distance, or direction, as in phrases like "all the way", "the other way", or "make way". It is also inactive when "way" is used to suggest a rephrasing, such as in "to put it another way"..

This head is active when  is discussing a delay or postponement of an event or action until a certain point or condition is met. It reacts to contexts where there is an anticipation for something to happen, but it won't materialize until a later moment or upon a particular event. This includes plans, decisions, actions, results, or conditions that are purposely delayed, restricted, or not expected to occur until a particular time or situation. The attention head seems inactive when the usage of "until" is more for expressing a time sequence or chronological order, rather than indicating a delay based on decisions or conditions..

This head is active when  describes a certain topic as a "field" but without specifying that it is "the" or "this" field.   It's typically active when introducing or providing an explanation, an overview or an opinion about a subject, specialty or concept referred to as a "field". In most of the active examples, there's an implied or explicit transition into discussing a particular area or field, such as in "at the time a male-dominated field" or "Sustainability Studies as an academic field".   On the other hand, it's inactive when the document refers to a specific, previously mentioned or understood field as "the field" or "this field", as in examples like "Cheng has more than 100 publications in the field" or "researchers in many field".

This head is active when  refers to the emission, projection or direct manipulation of light, often in a technical or scientific context. The head seems to focus on instances where light is used as part of a process or as a functional component in a device. It particularly seems to attend to situations where light is emitted, directed, or changes (like in the phrase "electrooptical change in light").   However, it does not activate when light is merely mentioned in description, as part of a broader topic, as a theoretical concept or as an inherent characteristic of an object. It also doesn't seem to focus on the properties of light, like color, speed or wavelength. It seems to be interested strictly in functional roles of light..

This head is active when  contains a scenario or context where an exception or specific condition applies. This exception often relates to the availability, requirement, or possibility of something under certain circumstances. The condition usually involves some form of exclusivity, indicated by the word "only." For examples where the head is active: "Excersire can only work if you are following a proper diet", "PagoFacil is only available in Argentina", "we are the only species that kills for revenge."  Contrarily, the head is inactive where "only" is mainly used in a general sense without a clear condition or specificity cited in the context. Examples include: "for one reason and one reason only", "this site is for informational purposes only", "The Body is designed for educational purposes only".

This head is active when  is discussing specific events, issues, or individuals related to the black community, often with a historical or political context. This includes mentions of historical events like segregation, civil rights issues, or notable figures like Barack Obama. The attention head might also be active during discussions about demographic analysis or depictions of the black community in media, such as in movies.  The attention head is not active when the term "black" is being used in a more general or non-specific context. For example, when used as an adjective to describe demographic groups such as "black man," "black American studies," or "black mayor" without any specific context, the attention head does not activate. Similarly, when discussing issues that disproportionately affect the black community, or referencing African-American heritage or culture without a specific context or event, the attention head doesn't seem to be active..

(31, 3670, 403), ' him', 0.625
This head is active when  mentions "him" as a clear referent to a particular person or object being discussed in the sentence. This attention head may be aimed at processing the pronouns that refer to specific subjects in a clear context. In these active examples, the 'him' is always referring back to the subject of the sentence or a person mentioned right before it is used.   In the inactive examples, though 'him' is present in those sentences, there is either more complexity in sentence structure, or 'him' doesn't directly refer to an immediate preceding subject. 'Him' is often part of a colloquial phrase or idiomatic expression or part of a larger conversational context which might not be explicitly clear in terms of its reference. For instance, in the example "he also asked what was new. I told him", although 'him' refers to 'he', the conversation appears more complex for the attention head to track the reference.   The attention head seems to particularly get triggered when there's.

This head is active when  suggests a formal or solemn expression of gratitude, typically made on behalf of a group of people or in a position of authority. The examples represent statements made by organizations, representatives, or authorities showing appreciation in a formal setting. Often the attention head is triggered by phrases such as "We would like to thanks," "I would like to thanks," "extend our thanks," "say thanks," and "token of thanks".  On the other hand, for the inactive examples, the attention head is not triggered because the gratitude expressed tends to be more informal, casual, or personal in nature. The context doesn't imply any formality or authority, or it's an acknowledgment without the formal or ceremonial notion of expressing thanks. For phrases like "I wish to thanks," "want to thanks," "pay thanks," or the use of 'thanks' with prepositions such as 'to' or 'for', the attention head remains inactive..

This head is active when  mentions a specific number of items, concepts, people, or anything else that can be counted, referred to by the phrase "of these" or "both of these". Often, this number is directly stated before the phrase, such as "both" implying two items or a number implying a specific count. However, the attention head does not become active if this combination of counting and referring is not encountered - for instance if usage such as "either of these", "none of these", "all three of these", or "each of these" takes place..

This head is active when  begins with some sort of explanation, description, narration or sequence of points where a follow-up statement or a continuation is expected contextually. Most active examples have a comparison or a series of connected thoughts leading up to the usage of "this". For instance, in the example about codecs, the usefulness of "this" feature in codecs is narrated and then followed up with "Almost all codecs use this". Similarly, in the example about losing temper, the actions of the day are stated and then repeated with the usage of "this".   On the contrary, when "this" appears in places where the preceding sentences do not lead to a contextually meaningful continuation or when "this" is used more as a connecting word in the sentence itself, rather than a link to the previous context, the attention head seems to be inactive. For example, in the inactive example, "Or is this fake news", "this" refers to the concept within the sentence itself rather than connecting to prior information..

This head is active when  is discussing ongoing conflict, debates, concerns or skepticism. It tends to become active when the text is expressing a notion of unresolved or contentious issues, depicted by the phrases such as "far from over", "outrage over", "debacle over" or "skepticism over". The context it needs seems to involve an element of tension or discord, and it predicts the "over" to indicate that the source of the controversy or uncertainty is yet to be discussed, addressed or resolved.   In the inactive examples, the use of "over" is more diverse and less connected to such conflicts. It is often used to transition to a subject ("over"), indicate control ("control over"), or to indicate the object of an action, such as a lawsuit or protest ("threatened to sue... over"). In these cases, the issue or action has often already been identified and is being developed or acted upon, rather than being introduced as the source of controversy or uncertainty..

This head is active when  refers to a specific event, activity, or occurrence that takes place within a current or specified time frame. The event or occurrence can be a variety of things - festivals, meetings, studies, elections, announcements, seasons, policies etc., and need not be mentioned explicitly. The context in which the term "this" appears is more about a projected happening in that given timespan.   In the inactive examples, "this" is mostly used as a reference to a time period, but not necessarily linked to a specific event - examples include age, increases/decreases in figures, releases, general activities or statements made. Some inactive examples reference events, but they are either non-specific, already occurred or not the main focus of the sentence..

This head is active when  focuses on a narrative or description involving women or female characters. The document often gives additional details about the woman's life, actions or status, often involving circumstances or relationships. However, the model doesn't activate when the woman in the story is portrayed in a powerful or wealthy position, as in the first inactive example. It could be that the attention head is more sensitive towards common everyday narratives rather than exceptional ones..

This head is active when  refers to a specific "show" that is named or uniquely identifiable, often with qualifying details or attributes tied to it. For instance, in the active examples, descriptors such as "Maru Maru Mori Mori", "the new season of his show", "the Brammy® Award-winning show", or "the British television show" are provided. However, in the inactive examples, the term "show" is used in a more general context, often with generic prefixes such as "a talk show", "reality show", or "the TV show". Hence, the attention head seems to be specifically triggered by distinct, identifiable mentions of a "show"..

This head is active when  mentions a specific entity (like a restaurant, casino, store, school, etc.) followed by a location and/or description of the establishment or event, and before the token "opened". However, it doesn't necessarily have to be a physical location. It could be any entity or event that has a start or opening.  In the inactive examples, although many have the token "opened", this attention head is not activated. This is because these sentences often lack a specific, identifiable entity and/or a description preceding the mention of "opened". In some of these examples, they refer to past events, intentions, or future plans, which the attention head does not seem to pick up on. Some inactive examples also contain complex sentence structures or multiple entities, which might be confusing the attention head..

(33, 3701, 508), ' have', 0.625
This head is active when  is designed to predict the occurrence of the word "have" based on information that is provided earlier in the sentence. This includes contexts where "have" could be used as an auxiliary verb (e.g., "the new abilities that have"), part of a verb phrase (e.g., "it have been revealed") or in the passive voice (e.g., "is a monstrous android that have").  The attention head appears to be inactive whenever "have" is not directly preceded by identifiable context, or when the sentence structure could accommodate another verb form such as "has", "had" or "having". This means it is sensitive to the grammatical arrangement of the sentence and its components, and only activates when certain conditions are met.   For instance, the attention head is not active in sentences like "*Your order was cancelled. Thank you. Your order have". This is likely because the head does not have enough context to predict "have" as expected, and the proper form in this context would.

This head is active when  contains a negative sentiment or expression of futility. It seems to key on phrases that indicate something is being negated or denied its value in a quite emphatic manner, leading up to the instalment of the word "absolutely". In the active examples, the lead up to "absolutely" often includes suggestions of meaningless actions, criticism, or dismissal. For instance, it becomes active when the preceding context includes phrases like "ignoring me", "say literally whatever he wants", "expected to accomplish", or "receives".   On the other hand, the inactive examples often use "absolutely" in contexts where completeness or thoroughness is emphasized, suggesting assuredness and affirmation rather than denial and negativity, like "over which I have absolutely", "do absolutely", "a court has absolutely", "given absolutely", "the operator of the unit may have absolutely". Hence, it appears that the attention head is not triggered in these situations..

It seems to be particularly attentive to phrases where 'things' is being modified or impacted by an action, often indicating a change or shift. For instance, "to knot things", "to freshen things", "to round things", or "to streamline things". In the inactive examples, while the word 'things' appears, it does not follow the structure "to + verb + things".

This head is active when  mentions an error, issue, or problem that is occurring in a technical context or describes a situation with resultant specific information or details. These mainly occur in programming or software usage scenarios, where the author is running a program, a function, a command or trying to implement an algorithm and a specific output (usually an error message or an unexpected result) is generated. This specific output or result is referred to as the "following". It is not active when "following" is used to list non-problem-centric information or data, whether in technical or non-technical context, such as available options or data fields..

These phrases often indicate an action or an event and its corresponding result or response, usually in a technical or problem-solving context, such as "I receive the following", "I get the following", "gives me the following", "throws the following", "generates the following", etc. These phrases typically precede an explanation, a code, an error message, or any kind of result.  When there is no such phrase present, as seen in the inactive examples, the attention head stays inactive. In the inactive examples, the term "following" is primarily used to introduce a list or sequence of items, steps, requirements, etc., and is not preceded by a description of an action or event..

This head is active when  contains more natural language, narrative-based content or conversational context, and it predicts the next token is "if" following sentences or phrases that imply conditionality or speculation, such as "making it look as if", "It looks as if", or "to see if".   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive in documents that contain more technical, code-based content. It seems like the attention head does not react to "if" used in programming languages or technical syntax. This might be due to the fact that "if" in a technical context would lead to different expectations from the model than in natural-speaking context..

This head is active when  ends with a phrase or sentence that escalates, summarizes or concludes with a negative sentiment, often invoking a sense of dismissal or negation using "at all". It often signals a sort of finality or a conclusive statement where there is a contrasting, denying or derogatory context. It is more likely to be activated by phrases such as "none at all", "not at all", "worst of all", or "doesn't have at all", which present this sense of concluding negativity or dismissal.   On the other hand, this attention head tends to be inactive when "at all" is used in a neutral or positive context or when it's used in the middle of a sentence or conversation without the notion of a negative conclusion. This includes examples like "First of all", "if there is any change at all", "say something is to say nothing at all", "No problem at all", where the context is not negative or dismissive but rather continues the communication or is part of.

This could include shows that are receiving awards, shows associated with a known personality, shows that are a part of a controversy, or shows that are characterized distinctly (like a 'talk show' or a 'reality show').   However, when the document is talking generally about shows without distinguishing them or if the show is mentioned casually and not as a critical part of the sentence, the attention head tends to be inactive. Also, in some inactive examples where special characteristics or controversies related to a "show" are not mentioned, the head also remains inactive. For example, "a new variety show" or "her show"..

Typically, these changes seem to indicate shifting from an individual or smaller group to referring to a larger group, or from one perspective to a more general or another perspective. It looks like the attention head is using 'They' to represent these transitions. In the inactive examples, such transition is not observed even when 'They' is being used..

This head is active when  contains a context where a stated action, condition, or event will not happen or is actively preventing something from happening.

In the inactive examples, while "won" does appear, it often does not directly refer to something not happening, or its usage is ambiguous or less explicit, thus causing the attention head to stay inactive..

This head is active when  provides a historical context or refers to a particular event happening in a specific location at a certain time. It seems to activate when information is presented in a "subject-action-object" format, where the "action" often implies some sort of change, event, or significant occurrence. The action might be denoting an inauguration, start of an event, achievement, detection or discovery of something that needs specific time referencing with "in".   The inactive examples either lack these precise historical or event references or don't have the same "subject-action-object" structure. For instance, "originally opened in" does not refer to a specific time or event. The usage of "in" in such contexts is more for denoting a duration or span rather than pinpoint a significant occurrence at a definite time in history, making this attention head inactive..

This head is active when  contains an overview, summary or a progression of events or actions that are developed over a period of time. This is often represented by phrases like: "what we know so", "what we've done so", "what I've tried so", "the campaign so" or "the tournament so". These phrases usually give a sense of ongoing actions or experiences.   The inactive examples primarily fail to activate the attention head because they don't present an evolving scenario or a summary of actions over time. They simply state actions or situations without expressing development or progression. Phrases like: "what I have tried so", "released so", "played all eight games so" do not provide the necessary temporal progression, review or summary that the attention head seems designed to detect..

This head is active when  mentions "calls" in contexts that imply either a general reference to the act of making or receiving phone calls or a direct reference to multiple instances of calls (phone calls, 911 calls, etc.). However, the attention head seems to not get triggered by explicit mentions of someone making a phone call or specific references to a singular event of a call, such as "a 911 call" or "a phone call". The attention head seems to be sensitive to the general or repetitive nature of the concept of "calls" rather than specific, individual instances..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  minutes after they left, I got another phone calls

(33, 35, 482), ' interest', 0.6000000000000001
This head is active when  is discussing or referring to a specific amount, rate, or increase/decrease of interest, often within the context of financial matters such as loans, credit cards, or economics. This could relate to a higher or lower interest, or a specific interest percentage. It also seems to activate when interest is discussed in relation to a governing body's policies like ECB or bank's rates.   For the inactive examples, it appears that the attention head is not active when 'interest' is used more abstractly or idiomatically, such as 'at no interest' or 'bigger interest'. The head seems to be looking for more concrete and specific financial references to 'interest'. It is also generally inactive when there's no direct comment about a change or specific level of interest, despite being in a financially relevant context..

This head is active when  refers to the act of typing or pertains to descriptions or specifications of the font style, size, or aesthetic. These descriptions can be about the font being "bold" or "green", mentioning of a "keyboard", or using the action verb "type". The attention head seems to specifically highlight occurrences of typing or font description within the context of usage or visual presentation.   Contrarily, the attention head is inactive when ‘type’ word is used in contexts not referring to the actual process of typing or to the font specifications. These include instances where 'type' is referring to a file extension, as seen in examples like "../fonts/Ahem. type" or "font "CormorantSC-Bold. type", when 'type' is used after a pronoun or conjunction or when it is embedded in phrases that do not explicitly denote the activity of typing or font characteristics..

In other words, it's relevant when there is a direct, ongoing or immediate action related to typing, demonstrated by verbs relating to typing, such as "start," "need," "read," "set" and so on. Yet if the document is merely referring to a visual font type, letters, or symbols without mentioning any active process or action related to typing, the attention head ends up being inactive..

(31, 1040, 341), ' know', 0.6
This head is active when  contains a phrase which includes a request or an instruction asking the reader or listener to let the speaker know something. It seems to be specifically aimed towards phrases where "let me" or "let us" is followed by "know". This pattern usually appears in sentences where an individual is seeking an answer or confirmation about something from someone else.   For example, in active sentences like: "Please do let me know", "feel about Apple's storage of Siri data? Let us know", the speaker is directly asking to be informed or updated about something.  In the inactive examples, even though phrases like "let me know" are present, the particular pattern that this attention head looks for - a direct request or instruction - isn't always present. For example, in "let people know it isn't everyone", there is no direct instruction or request to the reader or listener to 'let me know' or 'let us know' something, hence this attention head is probably inactive on this document.

It activates to focus on complex multi-condition structures often found in programming codes, and attempts to predict the likely placement of the following "if" token. It is inactive in the instances where the "if" condition is part of a regular sentence or expression, and not part of a structured programming context..

(31, 4255, 361), ' left', 0.6
This head is active when  describes a situation where there are very few quantities, options, opportunities or time remaining. It specifically triggers on contexts evoking a sense of scarcity or imminence, often involving numerical values or measure units such as 'days', 'games', 'seconds', 'digits', etc. The word "only" before "left" seems to particularly activate this attention head. Conversely, it remains inactive when the mention of "left" doesn't necessarily imply urgency, scarcity or reducing quantities. Examples like "with under a minute left" or "with just weeks left" where there can still be plenty of time depending on the context, don't seem to activate this head. Also, it doesn't seem to activate when "left" signifies leftover items or resources without a sense of scarcity or urgency..

(31, 2325, 538), ' well', 0.6
This head is active when  contains an evaluation or opinion about the performance, handling, or effectiveness of something, usually after the action has occurred. This is often revealed through phrases that indicate an operation or behavior ('execute', 'handle', 'working', 'fits', 'managed') followed by an evaluation ('quite well', 'very well', 'reasonably well', 'exceptionally well', 'really well'). Notice that the phrase "get along" in the inactive examples does not fit this pattern, as it does not imply a performance or action. This could be why the attention head is not activated in these instances. Additionally, the attention head seems to be activated when "well" is used to describe the outcome of an action, rather than the manner of interaction as seen in the inactive examples..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  lack of experience, Alvarez handled the transition well
✅  fits in really well
✅  just no room for middle ground between the dizzying histrionics, something that can become unintentionally amusing in high doses. Crime Story balances reality and theatrics well

This head is active when  seems to contain the structure of expressing appreciation or giving thanks, often seen in written acknowledgements or statements of gratitude. This could possibly be connected with an official, formal, or written context. In other words, it becomes active primarily in sentences where the author is preparing to give thanks, express gratitude or appreciation, typically seen in formal writings such as acknowledgements in books, articles or formal speeches.  However, the attention head is inactive when the expression of thanks is more casual or occurs in conversational context. This includes sentences where the action of saying thanks is mentioned in passing or as part of a larger narrative, such as 'came to say thanks' or 'never even said thanks'. This indicates the head might be less sensitive to less formal, spontaneous expressions of gratitude..

This head is active when  suggests the use of "thanks" as a form of appreciation or gratitude. It appears to be activated when individuals, groups, organizations or entities are expressing their thanks to others for something they have done or achieved. This can relate to a wide range of activities, including professional, personal, or academic scenarios.  However, it becomes inactive when "thanks" is used within structures where there might be grammatical errors or where "thanks" is not solely constituted as a token of gratitude, but rather as a part of a phrase or an idiom. This head seems to recognize the correct grammar usage around token "thanks". For instance, correct phrases (active cases) "would like to thanks", "want to thanks", "way of thanks", "cannot say enough thanks" versus incorrect phrases (inactive cases) "wish to thanks", "like to thanks", "would like to thanks". Common use cases where it is inactive involve phrases like "wish to thanks" or "like to thanks", where.

(31, 1382, 466), ' until', 0.6
This head is active when  refers to a future event or action being delayed or planned, but not immediately executed or released. The delay or postponement is usually due to certain conditions that need to be fulfilled, or milestones reached, or a certain time to pass. It focuses on the contextual knowledge that a particular event, product, or change will happen but will be held back until specific criteria are met. However, it is inactive when the sentence structure is more negation-like, stating that something will not happen until a certain condition is met. Also, it appears to be inactive when the phrase "until" refers to a more routine, process-oriented, or scheduled event..

This head is active when  contains the word "little" used in a context where it expresses a minimal amount or almost nothing of something, often in terms of results, impacts, or availability. For example, "find little", "had little", "there can be little". This attention head appears to be particularly sensitive to sentences expressing limitation or lack.   However, the head is inactive when the document contains the word "little" but it doesn't express the same context. In the inactive examples, "little" often refers to a minimal amount, but not in terms of lack or limitation, and sometimes it's even used in a positive context, for instance, "requires very little", "paying little", "provides little to little". "Little" here is part of a different semantic context, which doesn't trigger the attention head..

This head is active when  refers to making choices, decisions, or directives implied towards the reader or a third party. Sentences that involve options, permissions or instructions to do something at reader's discretion often activate this attention head. Also, it seems to be particularly active in sentences that involve legal or formal language, such as licensing agreements. However, it is inactive when the "your" is used in a context that doesn't imply decision making or choice, such as in the inactive example where "your" is used in the phrase "trying your"..

(32, 1541, 88), ' things', 0.6
This head is active when  hints at the commencement or intensification of a certain event or activity. The phrase 'to ... things' is often used in contexts where a particular action is starting, picking up speed, or reaching a climax, referring to various kinds of situations and activities - from games and competitions, negotiations and other interpersonal interactions, to the arrangement or presentation of objects. The phrase in question follows action verbs such as 'knot', 'top', 'round', 'cap', 'wrap', 'kick', 'spice', 'streamline', 'ratchet', 'reveal', 'look', 'preview'. This triggers the attention head as it suggests the beginning or intensification of 'things' under various contexts.  However, the attention head remains inactive even with the presence of 'to ... things' in the context where the phrase indicates a need for making sense or solving a complication. It is observed that the text tokens preceding 'things' are typically referring to confusion, complication, or a problem that needs to be.

(32, 4418, 123), ' all', 0.6
This head is active when  contains the phrase "at all" or "of all" where these are not at the end of a sentence or following a comma. It seems to be specifically triggered when these phrases are used as part of a larger thought or argument within the document. When "at all" or "of all" is used at the end of a complete thought, statement or after a comma, the attention head is inactive. This suggests that the attention head is sensitive to the context and the role these phrases play in maintaining or extending a train of thought or argument. The attention head might be trying to identify instances where these phrases are used to emphasize a point or indicate a comprehensive scope or totality..

(33, 2322, 88), ' after', 0.6
This head is active when  has the term "shortly after" or sentences that end with the word "after". It seems that the attention head is focusing on the specific sequence of "shortly after" and statements ending with "after" rather than just all occurrences of the word "after". This could be why the attention head is inactive on documents where "after" is used in the middle or beginning of the sentences or where it's not preceded by "shortly"..

(33, 1019, 347), ' like', 0.6
This head is active when  contains a reference to an explicit list of people, things, or attributes. In these instances, the predicted next token "like" is used to introduce examples that belong to the subject being discussed. For example "famous Brazilian magazines like", "outlaw country market in country music, like" and "social issues like".   In the inactive examples, while "like" is used, it is often in a different context for comparing or linking ideas, such as in "influence of the electric blues of artists like" or "company behind brands like". The "like" in these cases doesn't introduce examples but rather a comparison or association, thus this attention head does not activate..

This head is active when  contains sequences of structured data or programming code, typically in the form of a sequence of constants, variables, or function/method/table/structure definitions. The consistent use of equal signs, commas, semi-colons, brackets and special keywords like 'define', 'const', makes the document more formal and systematic. It appears to recognize programming language syntax, and maybe particularly aligned with the prediction of the token "mask" being used in the context of masking data, or operations related to computer programming.  On the contrary, when the context is general text, such as reviews, descriptions, or casual text that lacks structured syntax or programming code, the attention head is inactive. These texts are less formal and have a more conversational tone, lacking the systematic structure that the attention head is looking for..

This head is active when  comprises the usage of a narrative turn or an explanation as a context leading up to the "so". In the active examples, the phrase "so" appears in a context where an explanation, contrast or a consequential event is conveyed. For instance, a sentence ending with "...he's done such a bad job, he's set us back so" gives a reason for what is going to be said next. Meanwhile, in inactive examples, the phrase "so" is often used as a part of a typical response or reaction, or an expression of intense emotion, or at the end of the sentence as an amplifier for expressing appreciation, gratitude or surprise. For example, "I react so", "Thank you so", "I learned so" where it is not necessarily setting up a cause-effect relationship or explaining something..

This head is active when  is discussing the handling, storage, collection, or provision of a certain type of information, typically in the context of data or demographics. Its focus appears to be on sentences where the context involves details about the management or generation of information, rather than just referring to information as a generic term. This attention head is inactive when the information mentioned is not being specifically recorded, categorized, or analyzed, or when it is linked to a reward or specific request for aid in the inactive examples..

This head is active when  mentions rising or reaching upwards, whether in physical height, quantity or a date/event that will be coming up or happening in the future. The word 'up' in these sentences denotes an increase or a positive future expectation. On the other hand, in the inactive documents, 'up' often refers to past events, upbringing, or composition (i.e., something made up of something), which do not pertain to increasing or rising upwards; hence the attention head remains inactive..

This head is active when  includes contextual details around the event in which "won" occurred. In the active cases, it seems the attention head is looking for specific details leading up to the event - such as scores or performances in games, historical context, a specific competition, or prior achievements. This contrasts with the inactive examples, where "won" is mentioned but is often lacking these detailed contexts - the winning is stated more directly or briefly without associated specifics. So, the attention head appears to be active when "won" is used in a context that might help predict it, based on the surrounding details..

This head is active when  contains certain programming conditions or specific coding languages that utilize " if" as part of the syntax, such as JavaScript and Java. It seems particularly sensitive to cases where 'if' is being used in an "else if" statement. It is thus inactive in the cases where the context is more informal or in natural language, even if "if" is present in the sentence. It also appears inactive when "if" is part of another programming language's syntax, as in the first inactive example using Ruby language..

(32, 114, 548), ' about', 0.5833333333333334
This head is active when  contains statements of curiosity, inquiry, consideration, or a transitioning point where the next input token to be predicted is "about". It contributes to prediction when there are phrases indicating subjective evaluation, like "what’s so great about," "what you like best about," or "say enough good things about." It also gets activated when there is a phrase preparing for detailed explanation or facts, such as "need to know about" or "facts about."  However, the attention head doesn't seem activated when the word "about" is used in a more routine, descriptive, or fact-stating sense, like "talking about money" or "information about." It also appears to remain inactive when "about" is used in phrases expressing concern, worry, or negativity, like "have to worry about," or "worrying about." Thus, specific types of sentence structures and the contextual usage of "about" seem to trigger this attention head..

However, it does not activate when the experience is connected to a specific sector or skill (like 'parking industry experience', 'senior-level production experience'), expressed with a differently structured sentence or in a format that includes specific details ('with over 20 years experience' vs 'have over 20 years experience') or with more complex phrasing (e.g. 'decades of experience'). The number of years preceding "experience" also does not make it active or inactive..

This head is active when  mentions political affiliations or orientations towards the right. This includes specific phrases such as "far right", "centre-right", "center- right" etc. The usage of the term "right" in these instances is associated with a political context.  On the contrary, when "right" is used in a geographical or directional context (e.g. "turn right", "lower-right", "top right", "float: right") or as a position in a group of people (e.g. "center right", "pictured right"), the attention head is not active.

This head is active when  contains discussions centered around the completion or execution of a task, job, or action where "work" is the subject or closely tied to the subject. It seems to activate particularly when there's an evaluation or judgement linked to the work, whether that's the quality of the work or its success rate, and the discussion is related to a specific case or scenario.   Conversely, it doesn't activate when the context around "work" is more generally around employment or is simply referring to the functioning of something, without any detailed case-specific discussion or evaluative component. Also, when the term "work" is used in a more abstract context, like "sexually hostile work" or technical terms, the attention head seems to be inactive..

This head is active when  mentions either a specific time (like a certain month or year), an event, or a time-order sequence (such as "the same", "the following", "the next"), preceding the token "the". The attention head seems to be triggered when there's a need to establish a chronological sequence or timing in the sentence.   In the inactive examples, although the token "the" is used, it either does not precede a specific timing or event, or is not part of a time-order sequence, hence the attention head is not active in these instances..

It appears to be triggered by using "the" as a future time referencer. It also seems to be triggered by specific sequences such as “of the the” or similar patterns.  However, this attention head does not activate when the document mentions past or specific, non-ongoing events, or when "the" is used to specify particular objects, places or groups rather than indicating future continuity.

This head is active when  is expressing a state, condition or level that has been ongoing for an extensive period of time. Sentences where it is active are often emphasizing a sustaining circumstance or a long-duration action. The active sentences often imply the continuation of a situation using the word "for" before "so" (e.g., "Why is the loading taking for so“, "worked for so"), but this is not always the case. There is an pressing sentiment towards highlighting duration or degree in these instances. In contrast, where the attention head is inactive, "so" is used mainly to intensify the adjective that follows it, rather than indicating a prolonged state or condition..

This head is active when  contains a phrase or sentence that requires the addition of "an" to make grammatical sense, often as an indefinite article before a noun or noun phrase. In other words, the attention head is triggered whenever the text is building up to a noun or adjective that requires "an" in front of it, which can be identified based on its context in the sentence or phrase. For example, in the sentences "Reinstalling .net framework fixed an..." and "architect who receives an...", the attention head predicts that "an" should follow based on the context, as it is common in English grammar to use "an" as an indefinite article before words that start with a vowel sound. It's also noteworthy that this attention head seems to be case-insensitive, activating regardless of whether "an" is at the start of a sentence or elsewhere. Moreover, the attention head doesn't activate when there are no words in the input, such as in the last example..

This head is active when  contains a fragment in which "of" could be used to introduce a numerical or descriptive phrase following a noun phrase. This potentially suggests that the head specializes in "of"-led prepositional phrases that are descriptive in nature, such as "estimated magnitude of," "time delay of," "frame interval of," or "follow-up of." These cases typically involve a number or a specific type of description immediately after the "of," establishing quantity, duration, or categorization.   In the inactive examples, the "of" is often followed by another noun phrase (e.g., "tariffs of," "price target of," "angle of," or "care for an African crocodile of"). These instances tend to introduce another object or noun, but do not necessarily bring more description or specification to a preceding noun. This might explain why the attention head is not active in these situations..

The common trend in active examples is that there is action or behavior projected towards "her", or she is the significant factor in the narrative like getting along with dogs, being followed, being held and soothed, getting shocked, decisions being made about her and so on. The attention head also seems to be sensitized to certain descriptive information or storytelling involving "her".  In the inactive examples, "her" is often mentioned in a more incidental way or in a relatively passive context. The focus is not greatly on the actions or behaviors directed towards "her", but rather she is part of the story in a more indirect manner or the emphasis of the sentence does not fall on her..

Some instances involve using the person's experience as a qualification or contribution to a larger project or team.   Inactive examples might lack the specific field of experience mentioned or may not provide as detailed or lengthy a context for the experience itself. The experience is mentioned, instead, in a more broad, general way, often solely to quantify a person’s professional tenure without specific detail (e.g. 'over 20 years', 'at least five years', '10+ years', etc.)..

This head is active when  contains phrases indicating a measurable quantity or a rate or amount of some kind. These phrases are typically structured with the word "of" followed by amounts or quantities. These could be statistics or numerical data, such as "a minimum release voltage of," "a minimum deposit of," "an operating deficit of," etc. The metric/amount of something is usually presented or mentioned directly before the "of" token.   However, in the inactive examples, even though "of" is present, it's not always associated with a specific quantity or amount. In some inactive examples like "at a distance of", "a student-teacher ratio of", and "an operating loss of", although there are measurable quantities present, these quantities are either not directly linked with the "of" or the sentence structure is complex and involves multiple quantities or variables which could influence the activity of the attention head..

This head is active when  contains a pattern where the last word is "the" and the sentence or phrase is left open-ended or cut-off before its completion. Therefore, predicting the next token as "the" is logical because these lines are clearly incomplete. For instance, in the examples like "...email inbox once a the" and "Quote Of The the", we can see that the sentences aren't complete.  In contrast, the head is inactive in examples where the sentence's structure indicates that it is complete or when it's predictable that the next token would not be "the". For example, in "...as the Number One country single of the the" or "the Isle of Man comes under direct Scottish rule, which is formalised the following the", sentences are grammatically complete, and predicting "the" as the next token does not follow any logical or grammatical sense..

This head is active when  contains some indication of an action or procedure to be performed or completed, often related to some scientific, medical, or technical process. This could include administering a test, a procedure such as approving a step in a security process or advancing to the next song in a playlist, or using a piece of hardware or software. The attention head seems to focus on this sense of an ongoing task or process that is now ready for the 'administration' of the next step, action, or component.   On the other hand, the attention head seems inactive when the context doesn't specifically indicate an action to be performed or completed, or when 'administer' wouldn't logically fit as the next token based on the preceding text. For example, texts describing the active or passive state of a certain component (like a parking lever or a rod) or ones which contain code or mathematical logic might signal the attention head to be inactive. Therefore, it seems to be less active in examples which are more descriptive or static in.

This head is active when  contains some kind of description or explanation regarding a subject, topic, or event. It seems to be particularly sensitive to documents that provide detailed background information, facts, or statistics, such as descriptions about a place, an organization, a group, or a scientific concept. The passive voice appears to be another triggering factor. It is important to note that these documents often involve a form of exposition or explanation, but don't involve personal perspectives or feelings.  However, in inactive examples, the documents either contain more personal perspectives, feelings, or narratives rather than just detailed explanations or descriptions. Many inactive examples include more complex interpretations, such as relating to physical or emotional conditions or the consequences of certain events. The documents also contain more theoretical or high-level concepts. Furthermore, these documents often have more compound sentences and more layered information. They are also written in active voice more often..

Examples encompass charges imposed by line providers, rental companies, petrol pumps, credit card regulations, mobile services, memberships, and fees. In the inactive examples, the charges discussed are usually more mandatory or standard such as insurance costs, real estate agency fees, room payments, shipping and handling charges, processing fees, and property taxes..

(31, 2424, 605), ' charge', 0.5625
This head is active when  contains a sentence or phrase that ends or is near completion, where the next logical token would indeed be "charge". It indicates a price, fee, or cost that needs to be paid for a service or item, typically with a certain company, institution, or individual explicitly mentioned. The sentence or phrase usually explains a context of transaction, a rule, or a policy related to a charge or cost.  In the inactive examples, "charge" is generally not the next logical token as the sentences are already complete or the structure of sentences is different. Often, the mentioned costs or charges have already been specified or explained in the sentence, so there is no need for further prediction of the token "charge"..

(33, 4900, 492), ' of', 0.5625
This head is active when  contains a specific characteristic or condition related to a numerical figure or quantity followed by "of". Specifically, it tends to activate for phrases discussing rates, values, lengths, times, margins, costs, savings etc. For example: "exposure time of", "saving of", "rate of", "salary of", etc. It seems to be identifying instances where the "of" is involved in defining a threshold, quantity, value, or measurement.  However, this attention head is inactive when "of" isn't exactly related to a measurable or countable attribute or doesn't express an inherent characteristic / property. For instance, in phrases like "a distance of", "an increase of", "a penalty of", "reward of", where 'of' helps to signify an associated value rather than inherent characteristic. These phrases typically involve a numerical figure, but it isn't used the same way as in the examples where the attention head is active..

This head is active when  suggests a concept of distribution or spread that is wide reaching or global in scale. The active documents often carry phrases that denote dissemination of something (ideas, art, influence, etc.) to a wide or global population. The phrases also commonly indicate a sense of being 'surrounded' by something. In contrast, the inactive examples often refer to a procedure or action that does not inherently imply a dissemination or spreading out, or do not depict the sense of being 'surrounded'. Hence, this attention head possibly looks for context of distribution, influence or population-scale impact..

(33, 3801, 575), ' help', 0.5625
This head is active when  suggests that "help" relates to a form of support, collaboration, or assistance that is instrumental in achieving a specific action, task or goal, often seen with the preposition "with". It can also be active when the token "help" is expected next as an immediate need or request, as seen with the sentence "We Need Your help".   However, it is inactive when "help" is used in the context of a generic cry for assistance as in the phrase "public's help" or when the context is more related to health or medical assistance. Also, when "help" is used in a more abstract or technical context as in the phrase "with the help of linear, hermiticity-preserving maps", the attention head also appears to be inactive..

(34, 4199, 123), ' after', 0.5625
This head is active when  uses the word "after" in a manner such that it denotes a state or action that follows an event or another state/action. Typically, these examples signify a pursuit or active endeavor that is ongoing or about to begin, and the word "after" serves as a transition, linking the preceding situation to the next action or condition.   For instance, in "look after", it signifies a state of taking care of something; in "going after", it means pursuing or attacking something; in "sought after", it depicts being desired or pursued.   On the contrast, this attention head is inactive when "after" is used to indicate simply a sequence or order of events without implying an active endeavor, pursuit or transition. In such cases, "after" is usually part of timestamps or used to denote a repetitious pattern (like "question after question", "year after year") or part of a passive phrase (like "looked after", "suffered a relapse after")..

(34, 4043, 659), ' won', 0.5625
This head is active when  discusses winning in a context where there is competition or a contest taking place, such as in elections, battles, races, or awards. It's particularly sensitive to situations where winning is not guaranteed and involves some struggle, negotiation, or a noteworthy achievement. It also seems to be more active when the subject who has won is explicitly mentioned before the token "won".   In contrast, the head is inactive where the context of "won" is more routine, predictable, or doesn't highlight a significant achievement. It is also less likely to be active when the victory is stated as a fact without providing specific details of the event, like who was the person or the team that won or particular details of the event..

(34, 2202, 496), ' get', 0.5625
This head is active when  contains examples of programming codes, particularly those involving getter and setter methods. The attention head is especially activated when the 'get' function is public and is used to retrieve some specific property or attribute from a class or an object, such as "public string Source { get; set; }", "FieldOne First {get;set;}" or "public int getX(){     return mx; }". It seems to particularly focus on 'get' within structured syntax and not 'get' that is used within everyday language or other contexts.   Contrarily, in the inactive cases, the term 'get' is primarily used in a non-coding or informal conversational context not adhering strictly to the programming syntax. Examples include statements or phrases like "credentials too shitty to get", "attempt to get a pickup truck out", or "with heat you can't get anywhere else". Although there are certainly cases where programming codes with 'get' presented but they were not able to trigger the attention head..

This head is active when  uses "of" to denote a specific characteristic or quantity related to the preceding text. The words or sentences before "of" typically indicate a numerical measurement, a specific condition, a specific requirement, a specific feature or a characteristic which is the measure "of" something that follows. For instance, "receptor acceptance angle of", "frame interval of", "hue angle of", "a time delay of", etc.   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive where "of" is used more generically, often part of longer sentence structures. Predominantly, it is inactive when "of" is used to present a belonging or association, or to show a cause, rather than being a part of a specific characteristic/feature set.

In the active sentences, there is a focus on a lack of something or the fact that 'little' of something has been done or received, often implying that this is not sufficient or is problematic. On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the sentences express little effort being wasted or represent an insufficient amount in a more neutral or positive way, such as efficient utilization, natural limitations or mere factual representation of an amount..

This could include various scenarios like a publishing proposal, job application, or academic proposal. It doesn't necessarily need to be active in a successful application; it also triggers for attempts or processes where the outcome is not yet known.

This head is active when  includes the phrase "before" as a part of a past tense narrative or action, suggesting that something has happened previously or on past occasions. It is not simply the usage of the word "before", but rather the context in which it is used.  In most active cases, the word "before" is used with a past tense verb, referring to something that has previously occurred (e.g., "as mentioned before", "I've played with broken ribs before", "Newman has come under fire before" and so forth).   On the other hand, the attention head remains inactive when "before" is used in a context indicating a new, unprecedented occurrence or a comparison to a past state – essentially something that has never happened before (like "of all time like never before", "something we've never seen before", "unlike anything we’ve encountered before" and similar cases). It's also inactive when "before" is part of a more complex construction, including with words like "As.

This head is active when  contains a phrase or sentence that involves descriptions or comparisons. In most active examples, phrases like "as high as", "as well as", and "described as" are used. The commonality in all these phrases is that they are comparing or describing something. On the other hand, this attention head is not active in scenarios where "as" is used as a conjunction for sentences and is not part of a comparative or descriptive phrase. For instance, sentences like "TAAR1 has emerged as" and "his time to be recognized as" are just informative statements rather than comparisons or descriptions, and thus, this attention head is inactive..

These comparisons typically occur in sentences expressing an amount or degree of something which is considered significant, exceeding a standard, or expressing excessive amounts.

The attention head seems to trigger when the text highlights the prominence or significance of something in relation to the speaker or author's personal perspective or feeling. It does not activate when the context is more factual, neutral, or is discussing a third-person perspective.

This head is active when  contains phrases that involve expressions of uncertainty or ambiguity and need specification, such as "exactly which", "no matter which", "to which". It seems to be looking for contexts where there are choices, decisions or determinations to be made, thus the need for defining which specifics or conditions are being discussed.   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive in cases where "which" seems to be used in more direct comparisons (like "see which" or "find out which"), inquiries ("when and in which" or "from which"), or simple conditions ("no matter which"). These cases are less about expressing uncertainty or ambiguity, and more about specific inquiries or situations..

The examples show the head being active when describing diverse situations like someone being inebriated, a valve's open state, and economic conditions. However, it tends to ignore instances related to biochemical processes, like the enzyme's inactive state or the phosphorylation state, as well as more complex states related to technology or mechanism, like robot's state or reactor's state. It also seems that the head may not always be active when the state being described is denoted by a more technical term, such as "ketosis.".

(33, 3312, 123), ' what', 0.5476190476190476
This head is active when  suggests that a series or sequence of events, situations, or actions are being referred to or anticipated. This is often indicated by phrases such as “the first of”, “entering”, “launching”, “came off early with” or “the latest in”. This suggests that the 'what' will follow with a description or unique characteristic of these events, situations or actions. The key seems to be that there is anticipation of additional details or context to follow the 'what' in these documents which is triggering the attention head.   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when 'what' appears to be used merely for marking a moment or fact, or to introduce a direct or indirect question. For example, in phrases such as “marking what”, “developing and spreading what”, or “setting up what”. This suggests that the system deactivates the attention head when 'what' leads to an explanation or reason rather than expressing anticipation or continuity.   Overall, it.

This head is active when  refers to situations where power is lacking, disrupted, or is being actively supplied. Examples include power outages due to thunderstorms, power supply via specific hardware like cables or solar modules, or power supply being redirected or modified. Power in this context seems to be mostly about electricity. In the inactive examples, while power is mentioned, it is largely in the context of component characteristics, such as power consumption, or nominal mentions of power systems without indicating a significant change or anomaly in power supply. For instance, power level in displays or power ranges in components doesn't seem to trigger this attention head..

This head is active when  discusses a sequence of events or provides detailed explanations on specific subjects or activities. The documents where the attention head is active often contain temporal references or describe step-by-step actions or tasks. The presence of "this" in these contexts is often in reference to the specific event or task being discussed in detail.   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when "this" is used in a more immediate or generic context or in reference to something that has just been mentioned. Examples include instructions or direct comments, instances where "this" is made in direct reference to a single object or action rather than a sequence of events, or when "this" is used in a programming code or interactive elements on a webpage..

This head is active when  discusses or refers to historical, cultural or social aspects related to black communities, be it from a racial, civil-rights or political perspective. The key differentiator seems to be that the active examples are deeply entrenched in topics such as segregation, racial violence, racial bias, African-American history, black empowerment and representation such as black U.S. president, black actors in ensemble cast, and acclaimed black preachers. The inactive examples, on the other hand, focus more on contemporary racial issues, law enforcement, racial disparities, and legal aspects, rather than historical or cultural implications of the term "black"..

This head is active when  is discussing some event or action that does not happen or occur until a certain stipulated time or condition is met. It specifically triggers when 'until' is used to express a delay or postponement of something. However, the attention head remains inactive when the usage of 'until' is lean towards the non-occurrence or stopping of an event or action till something else happens or changes. Moreover, it seems the head is inactive when 'until' is used in contexts expressing behavioural or conditional factors..

(32, 4964, 538), ' too', 0.5416666666666667
This head is active when  contains phrases implying some sort of a limit or threshold being exceeded or almost exceeded, or phrases that indicate a notion of urgency. The phrases could express that something is being done to an extreme extent, a moment or action is reaching its limit or something is dangerously excessive. The flavor of the language in these active instances often relates to going beyond appropriate levels or doing something strictly or strongly. For example, these documents contain phrases like "trying far too", "take it way too", "don't tighten the nut too", "not a moment too", "pushing himself too" and "toxic level if taken too”.  On the other hand, the attention head is not active when the document contains more general expressions without a direct indication of a limit being crossed. Phrases in these examples often don't imply explicit urgency or risk, like "it takes too", "takes itself too", "way too", "drop too", "alarm before it's too" and "way too”. In these cases.

This could be in terms of the number of years like "over 75 years of", "over 55 years of", "16 Years", "over 20 years", "more than 1-year", "10+ years", "over twenty years" etc., or in terms of phrases like "a huge breadth and depth of", "both journalistic and comedic" etc. However, it seems to not activate when the quantification is less specific or less direct such as "with vast", "decades of", or "at least five years" and similarly in other such cases..

This head is active when  refers to time durations, counts of characters in strings or codes, or comparative phrases related to length (e.g., 'twice as long', '20 characters long', '50 times as long'). It also seems to activate when the word 'long' is used in questions related to duration (e.g., 'How long have they been going out?'). On the other hand, it appears to be inactive when 'long' is used to describe physical measurements or dimensions, geographical locations or directions, or an error in a script or program. Therefore, it seems to be triggered more by abstract or relative uses of length, rather than concrete or absolute measurements..

(33, 35, 605), ' interest', 0.5416666666666667
This head is active when  discusses or mentions interest primarily in a financial or banking context, and when it refers to the interest that is specifically associated with credit cards, loans, or rates. It tends to activate when the word 'interest' is used in phrases that talk about the interest rate of a credit card, the earning or incurring of interest, or changes to interest rates.   In the inactive examples, although 'interest' is present, it is often used in less specific contexts or in non-financial settings like "edition at no interest", "at the same interest" or "at a good interest". This might have led to the attention head not being activated. It's also interesting to note that the last example "credit card balances." Paying off the debt with the highest interest" appears to be financial but the attention head hasn't activated. This might be due to the phrasing - the term 'highest interest' could be seen by the model as an adjective-noun pair rather than a term about.

This head is active when  is discussing a context where an application or request regarding a process, project, or position is being submitted or has been submitted. In other words, it seems to get activated when the text is about the act of applying for something. This action could be in various contexts such as submitting a grant application, registering for elections, or applying for a project, among others.  However, it's inactive when the subject is not directly associated with the act of submitting an application or when the action of "applied" has a different context like being refused, being accepted, or discussing about a previously submitted application..

This head is active when  is discussing a response or action that should occur within a certain timeline or deadline. This often includes expectations or requirements for certain events to take place 'within' a specified time period. The head pays attention to phrases that indicate proactive behaviour or an action that must be taken promptly. Examples include responding to emails or requests, completion of tasks, deadlines of events or sales, or measurements of time when discussing the efficiency of a process or action. The head seems to be inactivate when the 'within' usage refers to a result or a consequence that comes 'within' a time frame, a condition or an event that occurs naturally or without direct human actions or responses. These usually refer to observations or occurrences in nature or scientific concepts, automatic or passive responses, or the expected outcomes of already taken actions..

It often gets activated when there is a setup or context provided before introducing the list or the series of information. For instance, explaining a situation, presenting a problem or a query, mentioning the use of a specific product or technique, etc. However, it is not active when the word "following" is used to mention something expected as in part of the natural flow of a statement rather than a separate point or set of points, like in the inactive examples where they are talking about an error, a value received, or a character trait right after using the term "following"..

This head is active when  indicates some kind of excessive or remarkable length, or when the length of an object exceeds a certain notable threshold. This could be something literally long in physical terms (like a 13 feet long object), or a duration of time that might be seen as considerably long (like a performance piece lasting for 5 to 7 minutes). It does not just focus on the presence of the word 'long', but rather it is contextual, catching instances where there is a significant focus on the object's length either to stress or to provide information about it.  In inactive examples, even though the word 'long' appears in many instances, these are regular or expected lengths, such as a string being 20 characters long, a film being two hours and 45 minutes long, or a request for a password to be at least 8 characters long. These do not activate the attention head as they aren't indicating anything unusual or over the expected threshold related to length or duration..

This head is active when  contains the word "off" often used as a preposition or an adverb indicating separation or removal from a place or a position, or to indicate the cessation of a process or state. For instance, in context like "off their backs", "off of Ami Ami", and "blow the lid off". The word 'off' in these contexts usually precedes a noun or it is at the end of a sentence.   However, it seems to be inactive when "off" is used in compound nouns such as "one-off", "take-off" or in conjunctions like "on/off", where the function of 'off' is not indicating a sense of removal or cessation. It's also inactive when 'off' is used to indicate a discount, as seen in "50% off" or "60% off"..

In the active documents the word "game" might refer to a strategy, a competition, or a situation in a broad context, such as a "blame game", "shell game", "ground game" etc. In the inactive examples however, "game" is mostly used explicitly to refer to specific, named games such as "solitaire card game", "the first Elder Scrolls game", etc., or game-related technical details like "injuries to the Redskins' running game"..

(35, 885, 512), ' His', 0.5416666666666666
This head is active when  seems to be making a statement or opinion about a specific male subject. Many examples include critique, accusation, praise, or detailed analysis of actions or characteristics attributed to 'he' or 'him'. The term 'His' in these contexts often precedes additional statements about his specific behavior, traits, or actions that build upon a previously introduced main point regarding this subject.  On the other hand, it's inactive when the use of 'His' doesn't mark a significant juncture point. These Examples usually focused on more general or mundane statements where 'he' or 'his' is not the main point of the sentence, like describing an action or behavior that doesn't drastically connect to a major argument about him. The instances also include when the connection between 'he' or 'him' and 'His' doesn't significantly add to a more comprehensive or impactful point about a specific male subject..

(35, 679, 691), ' The', 0.5416666666666666
This head is active when  ends with "The". This suggests that the attention head is looking for sentences or phrases where the token "The" is at the end, likely to predict the start of a new sentence or a proper noun. In cases where "The" is not the final token in the document or is sandwiched in between sentences, the attention head is inactive..

This head is active when  seems to have an incomplete clause or sentence leading up to the token "measures." This could mean that there's some ambiguity or unusual context in the sentence that the head tries to resolve, specifically focusing on verbs that pertain to assessment, consideration or calculation. In the inactive examples, "measures" is used in a more direct, straightforward context often involving numerical or physical measurement. In these cases, the surrounding sentence structure is relatively clear and unambiguous..

(32, 3582, 403), ' her', 0.5238095238095238
This head is active when  is talking about the subject "her" in an ongoing, continuous manner or context, usually involving actions directed towards "her" or activities she's involved in. This includes discussing what the speaker or someone else will do to "her", what "her" reactions or responses might be, or what "her" actions or behaviors have been.   In the inactive examples, while the term "her" is used, it is often within isolated statements, questions, or scenarios. "Her" is either not the main focus of the sentence, or there is not a continuous narrative about "her". This includes situations like asking questions about "her", providing singular facts about "her", or considering hypothetical scenarios involving "her". Also, in some inactive examples, "her" is used as a gender-neutral pronoun to refer to any person. It appears that the continuous narrative involving actions related to "her" seems to trigger this attention head..

(32, 183, 538), ' down', 0.5238095238095238
This head is active when  mentions actions that indicates a sort of ending or ceasing state which is immediately followed by "down". These actions largely, but not exclusively, involves an aggressive act or a state of completion of an event, such as "gunned down" or "shuts down" referring to an abrupt ending or "boils down" suggesting a reduction to a basic essence.   However, this attention head is inactive when the action preceding "down" indicates a continued or prolonged activity such as "track down" and "shut down" or a decision process like "turn down" and "handed down". In these inactive examples, "down" is used in a more metaphorical or idiomatic sense as part of a phrasal verb rather than indicating a descending action or state. This suggests that the attention head may be specifically tuned to recognize "down" used in the context of cessation or completion..

This head is active when  contains repeated phrases or sentences. In all of the active examples there are key phrases or sentences that are repeated within the document, sometimes with a slight variation. Furthermore, it tends to be active when the subsequent token "it" references some previously discussed or mentioned concept or object.   For instance, in the first active example, the phrase "dedicated combo challenge mode and take on some" is repeated, and the "it" at the end of the repeated phrase refers back to this mode mentioned earlier.  Common phrases triggering the attention head include "INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO it" where the "it" is referring to something mentioned in the document before this phrase.  On the other hand, in the inactive examples, there is a lack of this repetition in the text and the occurrence of "it" doesn't specifically reference a clearly defined object or concept that's been previously mentioned or repeated..

(31, 4378, 538), ' together', 0.5
This head is active when  contains phrases or sentences illustrating a merging, combining, connecting or unifying aspect. It specifically looks for instances that imply a tangible or metaphorical gathering or amalgamation of entities, ideas or aspects. This is evident in active examples such as " bring these two worlds together", "put two and two together" or "tie many photographs together".  On the contrary, the attention head is inactive when the word "together" is used in a context that does not involve a process or action of merging or combining. For instance, when "together" follows the word "taken", which mainly infers a conclusion from combined data or information, the attention head is inactive, as seen in inactive examples like "Taken together". Similarly, in sentences like "site where we will all come together", where "together" represents a planned future gathering, the attention head also remains inactive..

(31, 4378, 423), ' together', 0.5
This head is active when  contains a phrase that implies a coming together or merging of distinct entities or concepts, rather than just simple conjunction or simultaneous occurrence. Most of the active cases use the exact word 'together' but also describe a process or activity that involves aggregation, blending or synthesis - such as 'come together', 'pulling towards one another', 'merge' or 'ties many photographs together'.   In contrast, the inactive examples often use ‘together’ simply to denote things happening at the same time or to summarize previous statements (e.g. 'Taken together', 'put it all together'), without the implied action of merging or bringing separate elements into one. Other inactive examples use "together" in phrases that don't involve union of disparate parts, such as 'bring healthcare leaders, technology experts, and visionaries together', where the 'together' is about shared physical location rather than the merging of ideas or tasks.   Therefore, the attention head seems to be detecting not just the token "to.

(31, 988, 492), ' called', 0.5
This head is active when  contains a phrase in which a different title, name, or term is being introduced for the subject in discussion. It often follows the pattern of a term or a description, followed by " also called", or "what is called", introducing a new name or term. It seems to be paying attention to sentences where a concept, object or person is being redefined or given an alternative name. It provides context for the neural network to understand and anticipate different ways a subject can be referred to as. The attention head is inactive in documents where there's no reinterpretation or introduction of new term associated with the mentioned subject..

This head is active when  contains the word "first" towards the end of the sentence, often preceded by the word "the", "for the", creating expressions like "for the first" or "in the first". This usage signifies a first-time occurrence or introduces something new or noteworthy in a context.  In contrast, the attention head is inactive when "first" appears at the beginning of the sentence or phrases such as "first things first", or when it is used colloquially in expressions like "love at first sight". In these instances, "first" does not serve the same function of introducing a novel or first-time occurrence within the discourse..

This head is active when  mentions a change or shift in a state or condition over time, indicated by the word "used" often preceded by phrases like "not what it...", "what it...", "as it...", "like it...", "as...", or "any... than...". It demonstrates a comparison between the past and the present. The examples where the attention head is inactive typically concern adjustments or adaptations to new conditions or habits expressed with phrases like "grown used", "become used", or "getting used". These do not reflect any change over time but rather an ongoing situation or process. Therefore, the head emphasizes the contrast between past and present states..

(31, 2692, 559), ' used', 0.5
This head is active when  discusses changes or contrasts between a subject's past and present state or condition, often marked by a transition in time. When the sentence refers to something or someone that has undergone a change over time or no longer remains in its or their original condition or behavior, the attention head effectively predicts the term "used".   On the other hand, it tends to be inactive in cases where the document talks about situations or subjects who are currently in the process of adapting or getting accustomed to something, marked by "getting used" or "have become used" or where there is no significant transition conveyed in time..

(31, 4941, 538), ' within', 0.5
This head is active when  is describing an event or action that takes place within a certain timeframe. Often the statements in the active examples include a verb indicating some activity, such as "arrived", "sold out", "internalize", "show cause", "inform Congress", etc., and this activity is expected to occur within a certain period. On the contrary, in the inactive examples, even though there are phrases indicating a timeframe, the sentences do not specify any action to take place within that timeframe or the action has already occurred. For instance, "An allergic response usually strikes within", it worked retrospectively, referring to an event that has already occurred within a timeframe, not one that will occur. Similarly, "Watson can do it within" does not specify what 'it' is, thus the attention head doesn't activate. This shows that a specific action or event which is to occur within a timeframe is what triggers this attention head..

(31, 3530, 492), ' for', 0.5
This head is active when  contains a phrase that describes a duration or period of time. In active instances, the phrase before "for" often suggests a process or status that has been ongoing or will be ongoing for a certain time, often indicated after "for". Some examples include "been married for", "been standing for", "been around for", and "been in the industry for".   On the contrary, in inactive instances, "for" is commonly used in phrases that intend to show the occurrence of an event or action, without implying an ongoing duration. Examples include "thought for", "cooled through its spin glass transition temperature in a small magnetic field for" and "Treatment of these cells with NGF (100 ng/mL) for". Hence, the attention head seems to ignore instances where "for" is followed by a one-time event, action or condition..

This head is active when  contains the phrase "let me know", "let us know", "let her know", or "is know" at the end of a sentence or clause. It also seems to activate when there are words like "however", "yet", "less", "little" before "is know". It does not activate when "let me know" or "let us know" is present in the middle of a sentence, or when there are varying forms of "let someone know", such as "let him know", "let them know". Additionally, it does not activate with the phrase "as we know", perhaps because it is a common phrase and not indicative of any specific action or context that the attention head is trained to identify..

It's also active when the phrase 'get to know' is used, and in incorrect usages where 'know' is used instead of 'known'. However, it seems to not activate when the phrase 'let me know' or 'let us know' is embedded in a larger sentence or when other words are interspersed between 'let' and 'know'.

This head is active when  is about to use the word "know", particularly when there is some sort of information gap or a lack of knowledge expressed in the previous sentence. It is often activated by phrases such as "let me know" or "little is know" that express a need for information or acknowledgment of a knowledge gap. However, it doesn't seem to be activated when this phrase is followed immediately by "it", "her", "us" denoting direct communication or when negative sentences occur such as "unable to" or even when the word "know" follows the words "less is". Therefore, the attention head seems to focus more on certain patterns and context than simply the use of the word "know"..

This head is active when  implies or suggests a dwindling or decreasing condition, often closer to an end point, in a general context. When "left" has a more specific context, such as an amount of time "left" in a sports game or related to a specific task (as seen in the inactive examples), the attention head does not activate. The context in which the term is used seems to impact whether this attention head is activated. It appears to be more active for more abstract, non-numerical narratives. In the active examples, "left" occurs in a variety of topics that include sports, wars, societal issues, and numeric calculations, but they all suggest a general decrease or ending of a thing or situation..

(31, 2325, 341), ' well', 0.5
This head is active when  suggests evaluation or judgement of performance or actions, specifically when the word "well" is used to convey that something is done effectively, properly, or satisfactorily. It seems to be more likely active when "well" is used directly after a verb, whereas it tends to be inactive when "well" is used in a more general or abstract sense, or is embedded in a more complex sentence structure..

(31, 5069, 466), ' even', 0.5
This head is active when  contains continuous actions or states that sustain through certain conditions. In other words, it becomes active when the narrative discusses a phenomena or behavior that remains or continues 'even' when some circumstances occur. It's worth noting that the active examples often feature the word "remain," "continue," "persisted," or "retained" followed by the word "even" in varying contexts.  For the inactive examples, although they still use the word "even" following a similar wording pattern, the attention head may not be active because the preceding context does not strongly suggest a sustained action or state. Simply put, there could be nuanced differences in the context of the sentences that influence whether the attention head is triggered or not..

This head is active when  describes a process, state or condition that continues or persists 'even' in the presence of certain changes, obstacles, or unforeseen circumstances - implying a certain resilience or tenacity. In many cases, it focuses on an action or condition (like an effect, a power state, or directorship) that continues 'even' when something else occurs or despite a prevailing situation. However, when 'even' is used in a context that doesn't necessarily denote continuation, resilience, or persistence (like responding to an impulse or a fee not being applied), the head is inactive..

(31, 5069, 455), ' even', 0.5
This head is active when  contains a context where a certain status, effect, or behavior maintains or continues despite some conditions or circumstances. It appears to prioritize sentences using "even" to emphasize the continuation or persistence of a situation or action. However, the activation is not simply tied to the presence of "even" in the sentence, but also seems to be influenced by the specific context. For example, in the inactive cases, the "even" often relates to a conditional or hypothetical scenario, or is used in a context that does not convey continuity or persistence of a situation. For instance, in the inactive examples like "This effect persisted even" or "master equation, which remains intact even", these are simply stating facts without showing an unexpected or remarkable continuation of a situation..

(31, 2437, 531), ' these', 0.5
This head is active when  mentions enumeration or references several entities or items by using phrases like "both of these", "each of these", "either of these", "one of these" and so on. It seems to be interested in sentences that list or group things together, implying a shared attribute or a choice.   In contrast, in the inactive examples, these enumeration phrases do not appear to be present or they are not in the same context as the active examples. For example, in the sentence "*The second effect is the Thomas-Wigner rotation. The result I have from the algorithm stated above reflects both of these" the head is inactive even though the phrase "both of these" is used, perhaps because what "these" refers to is not obvious from the sentence itself. Similarly, in the sentence "*Americans have rights to worship and to assemble, but neither of these", the phrase "neither of these" is used but not in an enumeration context..

(31, 2437, 403), ' these', 0.5
This head is active when  refers to a previously mentioned set of objects, concepts, or entities and is about to elaborate on, describe or otherwise reference one or more of these items. Typically, the activation of this head is signified when the text contains phrases like 'both of these', 'each of these', 'one of these', 'all three of these' and so on. The execution seems to be context-specific, referring to multiple preceding entities that are grouped together in some way.   In inactive cases, although similar phrases are spotted, there are instances where this attention head is inactive probably because the previous context doesn't provide enough reference points for the head to group and hence, doesn't get activated, like when the context only has one mentioned object. It might also be inactive when the mentioned entities are not directly linked or grouped together..

(31, 4266, 538), ' by', 0.5
This head is active when  describes a definite or planned action, task, or objective set to be achieved or completed by a specific time or date. It focuses on verbs or actions that indicate an intention or obligation to finalize something by a given time limit. Notice that documents with words like "should be", "expected to", "is holding", "wants to", "agreement called for", "have to submit", "hopes to conclude" preceding "by" activate the head.   On the contrary, documents in which "by" is used to express some potential occurrence, expectation without a specific plan, statistical prediction or deadlines for submissions do not activate this attention head. Any passive statement or prediction for an event happening 'by' a certain time, as opposed to an action being taken to ensure completion 'by' a particular time, does not activate this head..

This head is active when  contains incomplete sentences or thoughts that need to be continued or completed, typically related to the actions and capabilities of entities (such as technologies, devices, cells, individuals, etc.) mentioned earlier in the text. It seems that it becomes active when there's a need to predict "do" to continue the sentence or thought. For instance, it's active in predictions like "existing wireless technologies do" and "low priority devices do", where "do" is expected to be followed by a verb phrase that specifies the actions or capabilities of those entities. The passive example doesn't fit this pattern, as the sentence can be logically completed without using "do"..

This head is active when  contains a statement or explanation of why a certain phenomenon, fact, technology, technique, or principle does not work effectively or sufficiently, or does not satisfy certain conditions or standards. The context in which the attention head is active typically carries a somewhat negative connotation where a certain system or method "does not" fully serve the purpose or meet expectations. In the inactive examples, the statement following 'do' doesn't mainly involve a critique or negative commentary on the functionality or performance of something, which is why the attention head is not triggered..

(32, 4964, 492), ' too', 0.5
This head is active when  suggests a situation of excess or going beyond a certain limit, generally pointing to the augmentation of a situation, condition, or action. In the active examples, we see the "too" is often used to indicate an increase or exaggeration of something - tightening the nut "too hard", letting a timeout take "too long", a summer going by "too quickly".   However, the attention head is inactive in documents where "too" is used mostly to depict an informal or conversational tone without hinting at an augmentation or exaggeration of the context. For example, in phrases like "I have way too many things" or "because I am way too tired", "too" isn't bringing the emphasis on things being in excess or beyond tolerable limits, but generally pointing out a state or condition. The sentences are more subjective, expressing personal opinions or feelings, rather than an objective increase or excess of certain conditions or states..

This head is active when  is using the term "out" in the sense of revealing or disclosing information or results. This could be through expressions like "turns out", "find out", or "it turns out", where the word "out" signifies a realization, discovery, or concluding result. It is not active when uses of "out" are in different context, such as "out of" in rating scales (like "5 out of 5"), or "year in and year out" which is an expression that means consistently over time, which do not involve revealing or disclosing information..

This head is active when  contains a sense of anticipation or an upcoming reveal. Phrases like "let's find out", "it turns out", and "read on to find out" seem to trigger the attention head—which often precede some kind of revelation or conclusion drawn from previously mentioned information. The inactive examples lack this buildup or suspense, such as the phrases "year in and year out" and "when I found out", which are more matter-of-fact or refer to a repeated action or a past event rather than a future revelation..

This head is active when  is referencing or emphasizing repeated engagement or interactions with a singular female individual. The repetitive use of "her" often implies a strong focus or ongoing connection with the female character, either by the speaker or another character. It is also active when the action or circumstance affects "her" directly, or refers to her repeatedly, reflecting ongoing interactions or situations.  On the contrary, the head is inactive when references to "her" are more incidental or non-repetitive, or where the context does not emphasize a focused or ongoing engagement. The inactive instances typically have more varied subjects or participants involved and often contain only single or incidental references to the female individual..

This head is active when  is making a clarifying or explanatory statement or assertion about the topic or issue being discussed. In most of the active examples, the phrase "here" used in the texts signifies the author or speaker trying to point out, emphasize or elucidate something specific in the discourse. For instance, it activates for phrases like "The aim here", "What is desired here", "What am I missing here", where the "here" is used to elaborate or pinpoint something. However, the attention head does not activate when the usage of "here" is more casual or incidental to the overall context of the document, such as in "there is a paradoxical relationship at play here" or "And Kelly shines here"..

It highlights instances where the phrase " at" is used to indicate a specific time or reference to a point in a document, e.g., a page number or a timestamp. For instance, it shows up in contexts like dates ("Jan 29 at"), specific page references in a legal context ("3d at 563") and specific timestamps ("2016 at 15:23"). However, it isn't active in documents where " at" is used in more general contexts, such as in sentences like "a behind-the-scenes look at" or "according to our friends over at", where it doesn't denote a specific timestamp or textual location..

This head is active when  refers to some sort of competition or event, often where a title, award, or vote is at stake, leading to the prediction of the next token being "won". This could relate to sports, elections, film awards, or any other form of competitive situation. However, it only gets active if there is enough context provided regarding the nature of the competition and not merely mentioning the fact that someone or some group 'won'. In the inactive examples, although the token "won" is present, the context is either not adequately detailed about the competition or the sentence structure is not compatible with the attention head's focus, hence it is not activated..

(32, 3393, 516), ' won', 0.5
This head is active when  refers to a direct accomplishment or victory by a specific individual or entity. In the active examples, the entities directly winning something are repeatedly highlighted, e.g., individuals (e.g., "Bob" - gambling win, "Historian and Mississippi native William Ferris" - Grammy Award), political parties or philosophies ( e.g., "Labour", "liberalism"), and a design ("the news that my design had won"). In the inactive examples, victories and accolades are mentioned, but they are often attributed to teams, coalitions, or are simply mentioned without a specific entity directly tied to the achievement (e.g., "an engineering team", "a separatist coalition", "the film"). So, the attention head is active when a specific identifiable entity achieves a direct win or victory..

(32, 445, 491), ' day', 0.5
This head is active when  includes the word "day" followed by another word or symbol, rather than at the end of a phrase or sentence. It seems to be predicting the space before "day" as being followed by another word (like 'by', 'in', 'to', a number, or a comma), rather than a punctuation mark that ends a statement. That is, it is active when "day" is used in a continual context, i.e., where there's continuation after "day". Therefore, it activates when "day" is in the middle of a sentence or phrase, not at the end..

(32, 656, 285), ' as', 0.5
This head is active when  contains a comparative phrase that signals a degree, amount, or range of possibility or expectation, specifically indicated by the word "as". It is often found in sentences that provide estimates or markers of uncertainty, variability, or fluctuation. In the active examples, we can see the phrases "as early as", "as much as", "as little as", which all represent a range of outcomes or possibilities.   Meanwhile, the attention head is inactive when the token "as" is used in a different context. In the inactive examples, "as" is used in various other ways such as a time frame (e.g. "as soon as"), a marker of condition (e.g. "so long as"), or to indicate similarity (e.g. "as high as", "as low as"), even when still followed by a descriptor describing a possible range. This suggests that the attention head is more focused on certain usage patterns of "as", particularly those denoting uncertainty regarding degree, amount or.

This head is active when  makes general references to a variety of fields, or when the document refers to a field in the sense of an area of study or industry, without specifying what the field actually is.   In the active examples, the head seems to be triggered by general phrasing like "in many field", "in this field", or "in the field", where "field" isn't further identified. It seems to be looking for contexts where the word "field" is left ambiguous or serves as a reference to various possible sectors of interest.  In the inactive examples, the references to "field" are more specific, often mentioning the exact field of study or industry, such as "a male-dominated field", "biology (or certain sub field", "an academic field", "a medical field", "the targeted allied health field", "in this field", etc. The attention head does not seem to activate when the term 'field' is used in relation to specific, stated areas of study or industry..

This head is active when  mentions the word "order" in a context that suggests the initiation of a purchase or transaction, the shipping or delivery of a product, or indicating the availability of a product or service for order. For example, the contexts of placing an order, a book being available for order, placing a customer's order, shipping units to customers who order, free shipping with an order, and charges added to each order.   However, the attention head is inactive even when the term "order" is present if it's used in a financial context such as inventory details, filling an order (in a financial context), details about transaction information, talking about discounts or offers, or when the discussion is related to customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction. It also doesn't activate simply with the presence of the word order if it's not clearly tied to the act of starting a transaction, implying an order can be made, or shipping or delivery mentions..

This head is active when  contains future predictions or expectations, usually involving changes or developments that will occur in the near future. These statements frequently contain phrases suggesting anticipation, such as "coming soon", "will be", or "again soon". However, the attention head does not seem to activate with statements where "soon" is not used to express near-future changes or expectations, such as "get over it soon", or conditional statements like "we will get there soon"..

This head is active when  includes a phrase stating something that has been attempted or carried out up to the current point, often ended with "so". Typically, this is expressed with phrases such as "what I have tried so", "what I've explained so", "built so", "reported so", etc. It seems like the attention head is picking up on the ongoing or completed actions referenced in text.   In describing what makes the attention head inactive, the documents do not explicitly mention an underway or completed action or process being described "so" far. For instance, in phrases like "Based on the images and promotional videos released so", the sentence talks about activities based on prior actions, but not in the format the neural network is looking for..

This head is active when  refers to an ongoing process, event, or series of actions in the past, leading up to the current situation. In active examples, the term "so" is included to provide a summative context about what has occurred until the present moment. Additionally, there seems to be a trend in the active examples where a specific statistical, numerical, or factual statement has been made prior to the term "so", linking it to a summary or current update of a previously described situation or event. The inactive examples, on the other hand, lack this sense of continuity or ongoing progression leading up to the current situation..

(33, 524, 548), ' state', 0.5
This head is active when  discusses a certain condition, state or situation that is explicitly described. The common feature in the active examples is that the state of the subject being talked about is clearly defined and qualified, often with additional information that gives context to the state. For instance, states such as 'non-rotatable locked state', 'open, unengaged state', 'current state', 'trance-like state', and 'liquid state' are clearly qualified.  On the other hand, the attention head remains inactive when the state of the subject is mentioned without much qualification or additional information. Examples in this case include 'inactive state', 'hydrated state', 'coma-like state', 'ketosis state', 'persulfurated state', 'inebriated state', and 'non-active state'.   It seems that the attention head is particularly triggered when there is a detailed context or specific circumstances that are attached to the state being described. The more elaboration around the state, the higher the likelihood of the.

(33, 524, 602), ' state', 0.5
This head is active when  implies a change or transition in the mentioned state or when the state is expressed as a result of something. The word "state" usually follows detailed circumstances that inform or cause changes in the 'state'. We can see this pattern in all active examples, such as "enzymes are returned to their inactive state" or "leaving the lot only partially cleared of demolition debris and rubble. It remained in this state".   In other words, the attention head is activated when the context around the word "state" refers to the ongoing state of being that is the result of a change or specific circumstances.   In comparison, when the attention head is inactive, the word 'state' is being used to describe a continuing situation without giving context or implying a change - whether current, future, or as a result of certain conditions. For example: "the atom is reused after its decay to the initial ground state", "mucosa in its hydrated state" or "valve is in an open.

This head is active when  points towards a list or a sequence of items or occurrences that are stated or are about to be stated. It engages when there is an anticipation of further detailed information, errors, or outcomes that are going to be mentioned after the word "following". However, it becomes inactive when the word "following" is used just to denote continuity or consequence but not intending to provide further particulars or specifics. The character of the token in active cases has a futuristic outlook whereas in inactive cases it does not signify a forward-looking perspective..

The concept of 'around' in the active examples often follows discussions of spreading ideas, influential actions, or situations occurring in an unspecified but implied various locations. In contrast, the inactive examples often use 'around' in a more specific context related to location or a literal distribution/action, such as describing individual locations, concrete actions or specific events..

(33, 1299, 492), ' last', 0.5
This head is active when  contains specific events or incidents that took place in the past. It seems to be focusing on single actions or events that were completed in the past, indicated by the word "last". The active examples contain verbs and past actions directly related to the context of the sentence where "last" is used.   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the last event or action is not necessarily unique or specific in the context, or the action is not completed or is ongoing. In the inactive examples, the phrase "last" is often used to mention time frames rather than specific events, or the events are less contextually distinct. Consequently, this attention head may be more sensitive to context and specific actions, making it less reliable in predicting the next token being "last" in every instance..

This head is active when  contains phrases or sentences where "by" is used to coincide with certain actions or procedures. This seems especially clear when there's a series of actions, steps or instructions, or when "by" is used in citations, credits or acknowledgements. The attention head is also active when "by" indicates a method of doing something or a means of achieving something. In cases where the attention head is inactive, "by" often appears to be used in isolation or in a more general way, such as in terms of location or movement. In the inactive examples, "by" is also frequently used in programming code and legal language, suggesting that this specific context might make the attention head inactive..

This head is active when  ends with an incomplete sentence or phrase that needs to be finished and that next token is perceived to be "what". The active examples mostly consist of incomplete sentences that expect additional information or explanation. They often denote the initiation of some event, issue or situation where the statement is not fully detailed - hence, needing the "what" to prompt for further details. Meanwhile, the cases where the attention head is inactive are made up of more complete sentences or statements that do not need to be elaborated or clarified by "what"..

This head is active when  uses "all" in a conclusive or summative context, often at the end of sentences or phrases. Some common sentence structures where this attention head is activated include "..at all", "..above all", "..after all" and "..first of all". This indicates that the attention head picks up on language constructs used to summarize or conclude an idea, or to highlight an important aspect above others. Conversely, it is inactive when "all" is being used more randomly in the text without carrying a significant summarizing or concluding weight. Examples include "..or all of the above.." or "..most important of them all" where "all" is used just as a part of a regular expression or statement..

This head is active when  contains a phrase where "help" refers to assistance requested or received, rather than being used in the context of a named entity or specific service(s). It appears that this attention head gets activated particularly when the sentence structure includes "with the help", "the help", "your help" and "enlisted the help". The head seems to be sensitive to the positioning and context of the word "help". The examples where the attention head is inactive include cases where "help" is part of a larger phrase describing a particular entity or service (e.g., "help division for students", "statistics homework help"), or when "help" is used without any preceding statement (e.g., "We Need Your help")..

(33, 3183, 527), ' opened', 0.5
This head is active when  indicates that a particular establishment, like a shop, store, or restaurant, or event (like an exhibit) has already become operational or started, often highlighted through past actions or experiences associated with that entity. It is active when a sense of recollection or reflection is present around the instances the entity opened.  For example, it is active in documents where people expressed their emotions about an outlet being opened, reflecting on changes since opening, details of an event when it opened, and mentioning when services or outlets have opened in the past.  However, the attention head is inactive when the context is about a future event or plan of opening something, mentioning just the fact of something opening without any elaborated context, and where "opened" is connected to ongoing or future scenarios or plans. It doesn't react when the sentence is merely stating that an establishment opened, without any past experiences, recollection or reflections provided..

This head is active when  seems to be making a distinct or exclusive emphasis about something. As seen in the active examples, the word 'only' is usually used to signify a unique, singular or exclusive capacity, status or purpose, such as "for informational purposes only", "identified only", "world's only", and "mobile-only".   However, the head is not active when 'only' appears as part of a more complex phrase that does not necessarily denote exclusivity, singularity, or a distinct status. In the inactive examples, these phrases include "mobile only", "adults only", "described only", "available only in Germany and Austria", "one eye only", and "online-only".   For example, in the active example "identitified only", 'only' is used to suggest the exclusivity of an identification, But in inactive example "described only", 'only' is part of a larger context saying that something has been described just in one particular circumstance or way,.

This head is active when  is written in Spanish or Dutch and when the word preceding "around" ends with a consonant. For example, in the first active example, "record" ends with 'd', a consonant, and "around" follows. In contrast, in the inactive examples, the documents are primarily in English and the token before "around" does not consistently end with a consonant. Additionally, in some inactive examples, the preceding word ends with a vowel, as in "seg around". Hence, it seems that the language of the document and the ending letter of the word preceding "around" determine its activation..

However, the head is inactive when "down" is used in violent, diminishing, or negative context such as 'being gunned down', 'clamp down', 'tear them down' and 'shot down' or in physically oriented scenarios such as 'turning it upside down'.

For instance, instances like "serves him particularly well", "got along quite well", "working quite well", "responding well", "play really well", and "fits in really well", etc.  However, the attention head is inactive where "well" is used identically, such as in "doesn’t bode well", "If all goes well", or "knows full well".

(34, 2599, 491), ' there', 0.5
This head is active when  suggests a functional or logical continuation that involves a situation, condition, or location; thus, the need for the next token to be " there". This typically occurs after spatial references, temporal references, or even hypothetical or interrogative sentences. Thus, this attention head seems relevant in contexts where 'there' acts as an adverb, pronoun, or as part of a phrase indicating existence of something or occurrence of an action.  On the other hand, the attention head is inactive in contexts where the next token 'there' simply acts as an adverb pointing towards a place already mentioned, or as a part of a phrase in an assertion. These contexts often involve declarative sentences and might not require a logical or functional continuation. Therefore, the attention head doesn't 'focus' on these inputs..

(34, 1822, 576), ' work', 0.5
This head is active when  discusses an action or state of working, specifically using "and work" or expressing a functionality ("does not work", "can only work"). It seems to be more involved when the token "work" appears in an action-oriented context, or as part of a compound verb phrase denoting active performance or functioning of an object or a person.  Looking at the inactive examples, it's notable that this attention head is not engaged when "work" is used more abstractly or to denote a physical environment, such as in "sexually hostile work" or "green screen or VFX work." Also, when "work" is used to refer to the state of employment as in "out of work," the attention head remains inactive.  So, it can be concluded that this attention head is particularly sensitive to actual working activities rather than metaphorical or abstract references to work..

This head is active when  contains a single, incomplete sentence that seems to be abruptly curtailed, with “the” used as the last token unexpectedly and there is a higher probability for it to predict " the" as the next token. It is also observed that this tokenization appears to be at the end of the sentence in the given examples. This could indicate that the attention head is specifically trained to handle and predict this type of linguistic pattern.   Examples of an incomplete sentence ending in 'the' include "See the License for the specific the", "All fields the", and "Russia 'amplifying' concerns around mail-in voting to undermine election | Facebook and Twitter take steps to limit Trump the".  In contrast, the attention head is inactive in examples where the sentences are either complete or naturally contain 'the' in their structure, rather than abruptly ending with it. This suggests that the attention head is not called upon in these instances because the conventional usage and positioning of 'the' within these sentences does not require.

For the programming codes, the attention head is activated by the "get" command in the syntax, which is typically used in object-oriented programming languages to retrieve the value of a variable. In the other contexts, it's the anticipation or planning of a future action that involves receiving or acquiring something.   The single inactive example given does not fall into either category. The phrase "as good as they get" is a common idiomatic expression where "get" doesn't indicate a procuring action or referring to the retrieval of any variable's value.

This head is active when  is incomplete or contains a fragment of a larger sentence that ends abruptly without providing the necessary grammatical structure to wrap up the idea presented, creating a sense of anticipation for the next segment, typically beginning with "When". In most of the active examples, the remaining text gives the reader the sense that something else is supposed to follow, to complete the thought or sentence. The documents often end in a preposition, conjunction, or incomplete sentence.  Also, in some cases, the head activation might also be language-specific; for example, the attention head is active in documents written in different languages, such as Danish ("Jeg kender til tre When") or Turkish ("ğerlerinden, ilkelerinden ve aziz milletimizin yiğitliğinden cesaret When"). This could suggest that this head is picking up on certain syntactic properties that are common across languages when a phrase is to be continued, typically with "When".  In inactive examples, sentences tend to be more complete,.

This head is active when  contains an abstract or generalized assertion that is not directly linked to a specific or named person or group of people. When 'have' is used to denote possession, engagement or action by a specified group of individuals or entities as seen in the inactive examples, the attention head doesn't activate. However, in contexts where 'have' follows mention of research findings, identified issues, objects, and general entities, the attention head is triggered. For example, in the sentence, "Applications of these detectors in x-ray fluorescence have", the statement is general and not directly linked to a specific person or group. Conversely, in the sentence, "Labour MPs have", a specific group of people (Labour MPs) is directly mentioned hence the head doesn't activate..

This head is active when  contains a situation, action, or condition that will not occur or be completed in the future. It seems to focus on incomplete actions or activities that "won't" happen for various reasons - maybe because of some prerequisite not being met, a deliberate decision, a failure, or a hypothetical situation that is unlikely to happen.   In the inactive examples, the token "won" does not fit the prediction pattern because it lacks the context of an unfulfilled or incomplete action. For instance, in some inactive examples, "won" is used in a different form, such as "wouldn't" or "won't", or there are no sufficient context signaling the scenario of a incomplete future action..

This head is active when  contains the word "very" at the end of a line or phrase. It seems to be triggered not only by the word "very," but also the word's contextual use, typically as an intensifier. Additionally, it appears to activate when "very" forms part of a common phrase such as "at the very," "to their very," "from the very," "to say the very," "this very," "my very," "your very," etc. The attention head thus aids the model in predicting the likelihood of "very" appearing in certain contexts. As the examples provided for 'inactive' are all blank, we cannot provide a contrasting situation, but we can infer that an absence of such conditions as discussed would lead to this attention head being inactive..

This head is active when  tends to provide a description, explanation, or an extended context about a certain subject or individual, usually denoted by "he". Often, these documents have more complex narrative where the pronoun "his" is used to refer to an entity earlier introduced and discussed in the text.  In contrast, the attention head is inactive when the sentences are simpler and shorter, and when reference to the entity "he" has less context or description. Often the use of "his" in these instances comes after brief statements or poses a question. Also, in some of these inactive examples, the text prior to "his" doesn't delve into explaining or describing the individual or entity that "he" refers to.   For instance, in "he instilled in me was a work ethic. His...", the text does not provide much descriptive context about "he", unlike in the active examples where the text includes a more robust discourse, such as "A player’s motivation is the reason he or she cares about.

It seems to be sensitive to documents that possess a formal structure or contain usage instructions or attributions.   On the other hand, the head is not triggered in documents that are more narrative or conversation-like in nature. Instances such as headlines, casual addressing, conversation starters/topics, personal opinions or text that is conversational or descriptive in nature do not activate this attention head. Examples include texts starting with "Welcome", "under the topic", "you may also want", "item has been removed because", "Sign up here" etc.   To summarize, the attention head seems to be active in texts that indicate a change of context or a start of a formal detail, instruction, or license, and inactive when the text is more conversational or less formally structured.

This head is active when  refers to an entity, organization, person, product, process, activity, or concept that originates from or is associated with the United States but does not explicitly state it as such. In the active examples, the word "American" seems to complete or clarify the subject of the sentence, giving it an American context or identity. For instance, "a group of American" suggests a group of American scientists or researchers, "Nokia’s onward march in the mapping sphere came when it snapped up Chicago-based NAVTEQ... leading American" suggests leading American technology or mapping company, and "Baseball Writers' Association of American" suggests it to be an American organization.

This head is active when  refers to situations where something is perceived or described as being insufficient, under-examined, limited, or not enough. The usage of words and phrases like "very little", "so little", "received little", "wasted little", "with little" trigger the attention head. This seems to focus on the sense of scarcity or lack of abundance of something in different contexts, such as financial resources, understanding, or effort.  In the inactive examples, although the word 'little' is used, it is not used in a way suggesting a lack or deficiency. Instead, it's either part of an expression like "wasted little" or it's preceded by "remarkably" or "so", which changes the sense of the phrase. Thus, the attention head does not activate..

This head is active when  contains a repeated "the" at the end of a sentence or phrase - the "the" that is being predicted as the next token is actually an unnecessary repetition and wouldn't usually be present in correct English syntax. In most cases, the phrases contain comparative statements or suggestions of uniformity, repetition, or equivalence (e.g., "the same," "all the," "exactly the," "substantially the"). The pattern suggests that the sentences could end with "the" as the last word or are used to suggest the completion of a thought or statement.   In the inactive examples, "the" is not repeatedly used at the end of phrases or sentences, and is usually followed by another word related to the context of the statement. Hence, this attention head wouldn't predict a repeated "the" in these cases..

It seems to be more common in formal tones and detailed discourses. It may also be active when the preposition "to" is used to express a direction or target of an action rather than a simple preposition of time or place.   It remains inactive for simpler sentences, especially in casual or informal tones, and contexts like news headlines, simple statements, and when the preposition "to" is used in its basic or more common sense, like indicating direction or relation, attaching an action to a particular time, etc..

(35, 2367, 531), ' settle', 0.5
This head is active when  is written in a sentence fragment or incomplete thought structure that requires further conclusion or explanation. It seems to be looking for cases where an action, statement or subject is likely to follow the word "settle", but isn't provided in the text. This leaves some uncertainty and proposed continuation which the head is targeting. In the inactive examples, the sentences are generally more complete and standalone, not implying a further action or idea to "settle.".

(35, 1296, 519), ' met', 0.5
This head is active when  discusses certain conditions or requirements that are to be met in a structured, rule-setting, or contractual context. For instance, it may be activated while stating conditions for using a software in terms of source and binary forms, with or without modification, or while describing the conditions that need to be met in a public license version.  The attention head seems to be very sensitive to such rule-setting or legal-like language. It is less active in other contexts when "met" is used more casually or in different semantic contexts such as fulfilling a certain level of quality, meeting a requirement for a job or product, or from a measurement or expectation standpoint. For instance, it is inactive when discussing biomass boilers that "met" a certain standard, or a phone that "met" a certain capability. In other words, it doesn't activate when the text is about meeting a particular level of expectation or quality..

(35, 1296, 558), ' met', 0.5
This head is active when  consists of terms related to software usage or distribution permissions, usually following a consistent pattern of verbiage. The pattern observed across active documents is that it looks for legalese such as "and use in source and binary forms, with or without *modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met."   This statement is commonly found in software licenses, dictating the conditions under which the software can be used or modified. In most cases, the prerequisite for this head to be active is the mention of such context about licensing terms - specifically when the clause 'conditions are met' is present without any interruption by brackets, special characters, or off-topic sentences.  Conversely, instances where this attention head is inactive appear to be in documents that include "met" in other contexts – whether it's some conditional requirement being met, physical standards being met in manufacturing, or even referring to a past event. In these scenarios, this attention head does not consider these usages relevant to its targeted.

(35, 1360, 123), ' in', 0.5
This head is active when  contains legal or contractual language, often related to terms of use, liability or warranties. These documents often discuss various types of damages, use formal language, and often use words like "including", "procurement", "substitute goods", "contract", and "tort". Furthermore, the attention head also seems to recognize sequences where there are indicators for structure such as use of symbols (*, //, **, ", etc) before the token "in". The inactive documents typically lack these features - i.e., they do not contain these legal or formal terms, or are using an incoherent structure..

(35, 775, 483), ' measures', 0.5
This head is active when  is indicating or suggests that some kind of assessment, evaluation, or calculation is going on or about to occur. In other words, when the text is about taking or ascertaining some form of metric, scale, or measure. In most of these instances, the phrasing implies an entity (person, group, study, etc.) performing an analysis or formulating value judgement. This can be anything from physically measuring a physical object or distance, to assessing a situation or performance. For example, "the Gillespie campaign measures" implies gathering of data on the campaign's impact, just as "the article measures" suggests the article is evaluating the financial activity of a religious group.  On the contrary, the attention head is inactive in the examples where the context doesn't suggest any form of assessment or calculation. Instead these sentences seem to be describing an event or circumstance. For example, "Mission San Gabriel Arcángel was founded on September 8, 1771" is simply stating a historical.

(35, 3476, 483), ' hides', 0.5
This head is active when  contains a list or a sequence of details, characteristics, measurements, or events and it is predicting that the next token is "hides". It seems to pay attention when there's a series of items, often separated by commas or conjunctions, usually descriptive, scientific, or data-driven information. It may represent the conclusion of a list where something is hidden or obscured. The lists often seem to be related to scientific measurements, events, description of processes, series of actions or enumeration of elements. In the inactive examples, either there are no such descriptive lists or the lists do not directly lead to, or imply, something being hidden or unclear, thus "hides" doesn't fit semantically. Also, informal or colloquial language seems to lead to inactivation..

This head is active when  has a structure or context where "the" word is supposed to be followed by a frequency-related term, indicating the occurrence of an event or action in sequence. For instance "once a the", "per the", "each the". Often it is about something that happens or is counted "per day", "per month", "per week". In contrast, the attention head is inactive typically when the structure of the sentence is complete without this frequency-related term or when "the" is followed by a specific time such as "the same the", "the next the", "the following the"..

This head is active when  contains a statement or clause that is incomplete or needs further elaboration, as indicated by a standalone "work" at the end of a sentence. In simple terms, it becomes active when the token "work" appears at the end of a sentence or statement, suggesting that the context to this token is yet to complete or come up next. This attention head does not trigger where "work" appears as a part of a completely explained concept or sentence in the document. For the inactive cases, the context does not need any further expansion after "work", thus the attention head remains inactive..

This head is active when  contains a direct or indirect form of a question, statement or expression that indicates an inquiry, doubt, curiosity or examination about a certain aspect without explicitly stating it. It pays attention to when "about" follows a phrase or a clause that doesn't fully conclude the sentence or express clear information, thus indicating more details or an explanation to follow after "about".  In the inactive examples, "about" is used more directly where the context or details referred to after "about" is clearly stated or suggested within the same sentence. This includes direct questions, clear statements or when "about" is used to transit between two related pieces of information. Here, the attention head deems the token "about" as not a key indicator for the network to use for predictions as the context provides clear meaning to the input without any questions or doubt involved..

(35, 4781, 21), ' administer', 0.47619047619047616
This head is active when  describes steps or procedures where some form of action or intervention, mostly technical or medical, is being carried out before the token 'administer' appears. Most likely, this attention head is detecting syntactic or semantic patterns that suggest an operation or manipulation is being performed or directed. Many of the active examples have a technical tone and are describing some sort of process or procedure that involves interaction with components, systems, or parts of a body in medical procedures. Specifically, the attention head seems to be activating with contexts that involve management, control, or directive actions.   On the inactive examples, the attention head does not activate likely because these samples do not display the same indicative language of performance or direction in procedures related to control or application. The document seems to be more descriptive or informative rather than instructive or directive in nature..

This head is active when  presents an incomplete statement or sentence that requires the insertion of "do" to continue the idea or action. It is particularly active when the sentence calls for an action or behavior that's not being fulfilled, or when there's a contrast between two subjects where one does something while the other does not. Inactive examples, on the other hand, are where the sentences are fairly and structurally complete without the need for "do" to continue the sentence, or when the subsequent actions or behaviors do not significantly impact the narration..

This head is active when  is written in a way that indicates a pause or continuation. Notice the usage of "around" that usually follows a halting phrase, sticks out as a lone word, or transitions to further information in contexts such as a place, time, or number. Look at examples like "B around", "record around", "far left around", "manteng around", "de rec around", etc.  In comparison, in the inactive examples, "around" is used as a preposition to indicate a particular point in time or a precise location rather than connecting or dividing phrases or sentences. Here, it serves more to pinpoint an occurrence or a detail. Examples include "arrived on the scene around", "documentary evidence back to around", "growing to around", "home around", "alerted about the accident around", etc.    The function thus seems to be related not only to the occurrence of the word "around", but also to its specific role within the surrounding text..

This head is active when  refers to a certain period or stage of life or uses the term "life" as a metaphor for duration or period of activity. The usage of "life" in this sense pertains to the lifespan of a task, product, process, or activity.  It is particularly activated when "life" is described along with a certain event or phase such as "beginning", "end", "during", "shelf life" etc. Examples include phrases such as "the last 10% of a machines life", "end of the design life", "end of a vehicle's service life", "end of the parliamentary life" or "deposition life".   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when "life" is used to more generically describe existence, living conditions, or lifestyle.

This head is active when  contains coding or technical instructions specifically related to opening and closing commands, functions or actions. This can be observed in instances where codes are written to open and close files, windows, methods, etc., as seen in the active examples.   In contrast, the inactive examples, while they do mention "close," it is often in a context that is not specifically about a coding operation or command. For example, it's used in contexts like poll closings, closing a case, or a date ending (start date: xx/xx/xx; close), etc. The usage of "close" in these scenarios is either part of an idiom or a language structure, not a technical instruction in a programming or scripting language.

It seems to be particularly triggered by instructions or codes that involve the command functions to open and close, or by descriptions of mechanical processes involving opening/ closing mechanisms.   For the inactive examples, while many of them contain the words "open" and "close", they don't follow the pattern of a sequence or procedure, are not related to technical commands, or their context doesn’t involve a direct step-by-step process. Examples of these inactive contexts include phrases that use "open/close" metaphorically or colloquially, or the narrative doesn’t focus on a procedural sequence involving opening and closing..

This head is active when  contains repeated patterns or phrases that lead to "The". It tends to be activated in contexts when a specific name/title is being repeated or a specific entity is being referred to more than once. These include repeated phrases around certain topics, or structures like website links and properly structured sentences. For example, it's activated in the instances of ‘Buster The Boxer' and the beer festival at 'The Apex'.   In the inactive examples, even though there are instances of "The", they generally appear in unique or first-time mentions and don't follow any evident repeated pattern, hence the attention head is not activated. Examples of such instances can be diverse phrases like "Content created by The", 'You Be The Judge', 'Garcia told 92.3 The', etc. where "The" does not seem to be following a specific repetitive pattern or structure..

This head is active when  is discussing a process or action in which something, such as a form or request, is being submitted or sent out, typically for approval or consideration. This is evident from the active examples which involve the submission of an application, grant, patent, or some other form. The document being submitted is often implied to be formal or official, relating to a critical context like funding requests, approvals, or visa applications.  The inactivity in the other examples may be due to the word "applied" being used in a different context, such as a process, method or effort that one has acted upon or 'applied' themselves to, but not necessarily involving the submission of a formal application or request. Also in most inactive examples, "applied" does not directly refer to a physical or tangible document or form being submitted for review or consideration..

This head is active when  contains a series of related nouns or noun phrases separated by commas, conjunctive or descriptive phrases, and then "hides" appears as the verb that applies to each of these nouns or noun phrases. It seems to be looking for contexts where the input is detailing statistical data, list of conditions, or series of actions/procedures in mostly scientific or analytical context.

This head is active when  is approaching the end of a specific narrative or argument, and the " in" token is about to introduce a new detail or point, such as a place, event, or specific aspect. The attention head seems to focus on the transition points within the text, rather than the beginning or the end.  For instance, in the first active example, the head activates directly before introducing the location of the beer festival. In the second, it activates before referring to Starbucks’ speciality. In the third, it activates ahead of introducing the timeline of a monetary transaction.   In the inactive examples, the transition points in the narrative don't require the token " in" to introduce a new topic or detail which is likely why the attention head remains inactive. For example, in the inactive examples like 'Adult females can reach up to 7 feet in', or 'Do not fill in', the " in" token is not leading into a substantial shift of topic or specific detail introduction within the text..

Basically, a token before “if” can be a mathematical operation (==, ! =), or a word like 'else', 'or' that is indicating a condition, alternative or another scenario. It is interesting to note that this attention head is specifically tuned to scenarios with a certain token before 'if', and not simply on any sentence containing 'if'.   In the inactive examples, the 'if' statement did not follow a token which signified a conditional operation or an alternative. In some cases, even though 'if' followed a token signifying a condition like "else", the attention head was still inactive, indicating that this attention head might be more sensitive to the specific context and the token before 'if'..

This head is active when  contains certain legal or formal phrases often found in terms of service, license agreements, disclaimers or legal declarations. These phrases are usually written in a rigid, formal language and have a particular structure of sentence. It seems that formality and a legalistic tone are what activate this attention head. The keywords that seem to trigger it are "warranty", "licenses", "unless required by", "applicable law".  On the other hand, when "or" is used in more conversational, informal context, or in numerical or statistical data, the attention head is not activated.

This head is active when  seems to be speaking about individuals and their personal associations with a high school - typically either their attendance or a connection to a high school as part of their background or achievements. The keyword "high" appears to be often followed by "school". It is likely that this attention head is looking for the context of "high" relating to education, specifically high school, in a biographical or narrative context.   On the other hand, the attention head remains inactive when the concept of high school is mentioned in a broader, more impersonal context, such as discussions of larger student bodies or geographical locations.

It seems this attention head is looking for error-prone expressions or broken sentences where "met" is not used properly at the end of a sentence or idea. In the examples where the attention head is inactive, the usage of "met" is within complete and grammatically-correct sentences, usually specifying certain conditions being met. The head doesn't activate in these properly constructed cases.

The attention head seems to be particularly sensitive to phrases that explicitly state the act of paying, e.g., "pay your bill", or saving on a bill, e.g., "lower grocery bill".   On the other hand, the head is inactive when the references to bill are embedded in more complex scenarios or explanations, such as availability of resources to reduce a bill, discussing the impacts of policies on bills, or in legal contexts. In these instances, the next token isn't directly related to the act of paying or saving on a bill. Examples include "percent addition of wind generation would reduce customer bill" or "$6.2 million in legal bill".   Essentially, this attention head seems to be looking for direct and explicit mentions of paying or saving on bills. It isn.

This head is active when  is written in third person singular form primarily referring to a male subject. It is likely that this attention head is trying to predict "her" which will be attached to a noun that belongs to a male subject. For instance, in the example "The man, thought to be in her", the pronoun "her" probably refers to a possession of the man, such as "her house" or "her car".   In the attention inactive examples, though "her" is present, it’s used inconsistently or not directly referring to a male subject. For example, in “* video of the women, believed to be aged in her”, “her” is being used to refer to a female subject, contradicting the pattern of the active examples. Similarly, in "* he lost the use of his legs from the waist down. They thought he’d be paralyzed for the rest of her", "her" is clearly grammatically incorrect as it contradicts with the previously mentioned "his".  In.

(34, 4199, 88), ' after', 0.4375
This head is active when  contains the word "after" that is part of a verb phrase or expression, where the key action is specified after the term "after." For instance, in "look after," "go after," "come after," "going after," and "soon after," the term "after" is paired with a verb to form a phrase suggesting a particular action or event that occurs following something else.   On the contrary, the attention head is inactive when "after" is part of an adjective phrase or a hyphenated word, such as "sought-after," or when "after" follows a span of time, as in "24 hours after." In these cases, "after" does not indicate an action or event but rather forms part of a descriptive term or a segment of time. Therefore, the contrast between active and inactive instances of this attention head suggests its focus on the usage of "after" in verb phrases or event descriptions..

This head is active when  intends to provide some information, description, or action extending to a subject or topic. It seems to focus on documents where a prolonged description or explanation is being provided about a particular subject. This can include detail-oriented contexts such as descriptions of situations, strategies, activities, histories, or processes. This attention head also could be more active when the information is leading to some sort of a conclusion or a directional goal, especially when an action is associated with the subject in focus, or when predictions or future-related discussions are presented.   In the inactive examples, this attention head does not activate presumably because they often present brief, standalone facts or statements, lacking extended descriptions or discussions. They don't involve describing a process or action related to a topic in detail, or leading to a directional goal. The context also lacks a component of subject+action leading to a conclusion or prediction. This explains why the attention head would not be triggered in these cases..

This head is active when  contains grammatically correct sentences with coherent syntax and well-defined preceding context that leads to the use of "an". It becomes active specifically before an occurrence of "an" which contributes to the meaningful structure of the sentence.   Most active examples contain a well-defined context providing a logical place for an "an" like "designed with an", "won an", "from an", etc. It seems that this attention head is focusing on correctly predicting "an" when the contextual information leads to a word that starts with a vowel, thus requiring to use "an" instead of "a".   Meanwhile, in case inactive example given with "hydrocarbon an", the word "an" is part of another word, not standing as a separate token that introduces an object, description, or event following it. Hence, the attention head is inactive as in this context "an" doesn't perform the grammatical role it's trained to recognize..

The active examples show a context in which the information is being actively used or sought to complete a task or make a decision.

The attention head seems to be predicting the token "myself" in these contexts as a completion attempt.

This could be in the form of actions directly affecting "her", objects given to "her", or discourse involving "her".  In the inactive examples, although "her" is still used as an object in some instances, it often takes place in a more speculative or hypothetical context. Also, there are instances where "her" doesn't immediately follow an action, condition, or description that directly involves "her", making the attention head inactive. Furthermore, it seems "her" as part of possessive structures ("her back", "her belly") doesn't activate the attention head.

This head is active when  has a repetitive structure, where multiple phrases or parts of the text follow a similar pattern or rhythm. This can be noticed in specific arrangements of words that seem to have some sort of structure, rhythm, or repetition. However, it remains inactive when such patterns are not present. In majority of the active examples, it can be noticed that the attention head is triggered when there is an apparent repetitive occurrence of the word "the". This head seems to be specialized in predicting the token "the" when the surrounding context has a somewhat repetitive cadence or rhythm, even if it isn't exactly the same phrase that's being repeated..

This head is active when  ends with a standalone word that can be directly followed by the token "Powered". In the active examples, we can see that the sentence before "Powered" ends with singular, standalone concepts, terms, or short, succinct statements. For instance, in cases like "...in a community sample of adults (n = 124) with the full range of BPD symptoms. Powered" or "...cause significant economic and ecological damage worldwide. Powered", the sentences preceding the token are complete and follow a logical structure, leaving room for the token "Powered" as a standalone word.   In contrast, in the inactive examples, the preceding text tends to be either complex or part of an ongoing idea which can't be logically followed by the token "Powered". A common theme among inactive examples is the presence of parenthetical information, detailed statements or continued exploratory descriptions which do not conclude in a way that can be concisely followed by "Powered", such as in the cases of "...courses include lessons in.

This head is active when  uses " so" to indicate continuation or intensifies an action, feeling, or state. It primarily activates when " so" is used as an intensifier for verbs or to signify that something is done 'to a great extent'. Examples include "taking so", "love it so", "done so", "contrasts so", "learned so", where "so" intensifies the preceding verb or phrase.   In the inactive examples, " so" is frequently used at the end of sentences in a thanking context ("Thank you so") or to indicate an elongated period ("for so", "loved for so", "known about them for so"), which doesn't require the need of this head for prediction. Thus, the attention head deactivates in these scenarios. This could be due to the distinction between 'so' used as an adverb and 'so' used as a conjunction..

This head is active when  refers to something performing, acting, or functioning well in a broader sense. The head seems to be looking for sentences where "well" is an adverb modifying a verb and involves a process, action, or duty being done efficiently or proficiently. Direct associations such as 'doing well', 'working well', 'performing well', 'handling well', treat well', are activating this head. In the inactive examples, "well" is often used in phrases that highlight compatibility, fit, or agreement such as 'fits well', 'sums up well', 'manages well', or 'arrives well'. These don't involve any action or performance but rather an effective result or outcome. The inactive examples also demonstrate good relationships ('get along well') which don't activate this attention head..

It seems to evaluate sentences where there is some explanatory or descriptive context followed by a location. It is inactive when the document is just marking time or locations, or generally stating something occurs at a place, without a specific event being mentioned or described. It ignores sentences where the focus isn't on specific events, actions, or occurrences linked with a place..

This head is active when  contains repetitive information or refers to the same subject, often in lists, details, or specifications. In these cases, the repetition ends with the preposition "in". For example, in the first active example, it describes the sizes of adult male and female animals, repeating the phrase twice. In the second active case, it recounts the sequence of events related to a sports contract, repeating the key details again. Similarly in case of third example; same thing has been discussed twice.   In contrast, the head is inactive when there's no such pattern of repetition leading to the use of "in", as seen in the inactive examples. Here, the usage of "in" is random and not bound by any repetitive pattern or the need to end a recurring subject of information..

This head is active when  contains a reference to a named noun or a proper name right before the token "The". This noun can be a person's name, a title, a location, or a specific object. On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the document does not possess such a proper name or specific noun preceding the token "The". It tends to be inactive when "The" starts a new sentence or follows a general term, punctuation mark, or a numerical value. Thus, this head seems to be designed to handle cases where "The" is part of a proper name or title. Some active examples include "Apex in Bury St Edmunds", "Buster The Boxer", or "Faith Baptist Bible College", and some inactive examples include sentences starting with "The" or "The" following a numerical value or a punctuation mark..

This head is active when  contains code or programming language syntax. It seems to be particularly sensitive to instances of conditionals like "if", especially when embedded within the structure of a line of code. As such, this attention head may be useful for parsing and interpreting code-based documents or for tasks related to programming language processing.   The attention head is inactive when the token "if" appears in natural language sentences, within conversational, descriptive or narrative context, rather than structured code or programming syntax. Therefore, this attention head does not seem to be activated by the use of "if" in general English language usage..

The document pattern doesn't appear to be impacted by the symbols or characters at the beginning of the document since they vary across examples. It seems the attention head's activation isn't affected by the inclusion or exclusion of a URL either.  However, in the inactive examples, the documents either have additional content between the 'LICENSE-2.0' token and the 'Unless required by law' phrase or different context altogether. Hence, it seems that the specific context of having "Unless required by applicable law of" followed by the 'of' token is vital for this attention head's activation..

These phrases are typically used when the writer is about to reveal a piece of information or is encouraging the reader to discover something for themselves.

The token "bill" is often preceded by phrases or clauses that express some sort of cost-cutting, efficiency, or reduction, often in the context of energy use, financial strategy, or smart decision-making. These could be directly related to the "bill" (like in "lower grocery bill" or "reducing your overall interest bill") or could be indirect or implied (like "expect higher hotel bill" in the context of an event, or "save big when it comes to energy bill").  In contrast, the inactive examples talk about "bill" often in a negative context without explicitly mentioning any action or strategy leading to reduction.

We can see this in statements about lawyers, boxers, cyclists, or even lottery winners.  On the other hand, it seems inactive when the achievement is highly collective (a team win), when the achievements pertain to non-competitive or non-traditional events (like an actor from a soap opera winning for the first time), or where the 'victory' theme is not as apparent or relevant to the overall context of the statement (as in the last example where different political parties ‘won’ seats, representing more a distribution of wins rather than a singular achievement).

As a key pattern that denotes the activation, we can see that "little" is often preceded by personal pronouns (e.g., 'there is', 'we can see') or verbs conveying a passive sense of existence or state (e.g., 'is', 'has been', 'can be') in the active cases. Additionally, these sentences often lack any sort of negation preceding 'little',contrary.

This head is active when  refers to a context in which "Wednesday" is a regular, or recurring event, or has a clear chronological relation in the text. Examples include days of the week in a job schedule, regular broadcast days for a program, a routine like "every Wednesday", or a definite event like a birthday falling on Wednesday. It also appears to activate when there is a clear sequence or order of days, like "Monday to Wednesday" or "Monday and... Wednesday".  The attention head is inactive in instances where "Wednesday" is mentioned in a less regular context, for instance pertaining to a specific past or future event like Superbowl Wednesday, Bloody Wednesday or referencing peculiar date instances. Similarly, it seems inactive in instances where "Wednesday" is not integral to the rhythm or sequence of the text, like "I knew it would suck up my daytime reading a lot... Anyway, this past Wednesday". Other inactivity triggers include "every other Wednesday", "next to the last Wednesday" - phrases that lend.

This head is active when  is discussing lists, rankings or mentions of significant events or items from a specific time period, usually a year. The "of" typically serves to introduce the said period. This is seen in sentences that involve phrases like the "best", "most-anticipated", "most-influential", "best horror films", or "lowest-rating" of a certain period, often acknowledging a highlight, achievement or record.  The attention head is inactive in documents that, while they mention a time period following "of", are not highlighting, ranking or referencing notable events or items from that period. For example, these documents might simply be stating a fact or detail from the specified time period. Some sentences also seem to abruptly end with "of", implying they might have been cut off, which could explain the inactivity..

This head is active when  discusses concepts or phenomena in a scientific or technical way, particularly in the context of describing or defining mechanisms. Phrases that commonly activate this attention head include "mechanism(s) by in", "identify/defining the mechanisms by in" and similar variations. These texts frequently seem to relate to various fields of scientific research, such as biology, medicine, or technical processes.  The attention head is inactive when the document isn't focused on defining or exploring specific mechanisms or systems but instead discussing other context or forming other styles of sentences. Some of the inactive examples show a wider range of topics and writing styles, such as current events, legal issues, and conversational language. For instance, "ate the mechanisms by in" does not clarify what mechanisms are being discussed or how they are relevant to the surrounding text.

This head is active when  discusses something not functioning or not working properly, a strategy being ineffective, or potential reasons why something might fail to work. The key here seems to be the issue of something not working as intended, discussed either directly or implicitly. For instance, in the active documents, there is mention of things being "incompatible," "wouldn’t work," and "doesn't work."   In the inactive documents, on the other hand, the attention head seems inactive because while the term 'work' is being used, it's often in a context of someone doing work or a reference to employment/working conditions. It isn't used to discuss the concept of something failing to function properly or a strategy not being successful. Therefore, the context in which 'work' is used seems to trigger the attention head's activity..

For example, phrases like "immigrate to the the", "to the New World", "United the", and variations of these trigger this attention head. It's capturing the pattern that a reference to the United States by either a full or abbreviated name tends to be followed by " the".   In contrast, when the document uses the full term "the United States" or refers to a specific office or role within the United States (e.g., "President of the the"), the attention head is not activated.

For example, in the sentence, "...calls for the replacement of fossil fuels with space", "space" represents a gap that needs to be filled with an alternate source of energy. Similarly, in the phrase "...uses Orbital's standard LEOStar-3 space", 'space' is introduced as a category for LEOStar-3.  However, it doesn't get activated when "space" is part of a proper noun, like "National Air and Space" or is used in a nominal phrase where it doesn't anticipate or represent a gap or empty value, e.g., "Sign up for Daily space" or "the NASCAR SuperT space".

The attention head is inactive in documents that primarily discuss renewable energy, environmental policies, pop culture, or daily life situations where the use of the word "space" would not naturally fit within the topic.

On the other hand, in the inactive examples, help is generally stated in a past context, like "with the help", "enlisted the help", and "sought the help", or they are subtly stated as a part of a larger narrative where the need for help is not the focus, such as "need help", "going for help" and "call for help". Here, help is used more as a supporting component to the storyline or action described, rather than the main subject of discourse..

This head is active when  consists of a sentence or phrase that ends abruptly and where 'The' is likely to be a start of a new sentence or a continuation of the existing sentence with the introduction of a new entity or title. 'The' is often used at the beginning of a sentence when referring to a specific item or person.   In documents where this head is inactive, 'The' is either preceded by 'at' (indicating a place location), it's a part of multiple repetitive phrases, used within a URL, or used within a bracketed or quoted part of the sentence. In these scenarios, 'The' does not seem to be initiating a new idea or entity, making the attention head inactive..

This head is active when  contains a sequence of events, facts or statements and there is a transition or continuation implied, often with the conjunction "and". Essentially, it activates when there is a multi-part list or series of related occurrences or facts, and "hides" refers to the continuation of this sequence. For instance, in the first example, it talks about the evolution of RPG games in a historical context. In the second example, the text talks about experiences with vinyl collecting. The series or lists are not typically numerical or ordered, but they are connected in topic or theme.  The head is inactive where this condition is not met. In the inactive examples, the sentences are usually reports of a single event, statement, or fact, or they contain information that doesn't follow a clear sequence of related events. Even though some inactive samples also use "and", they do not use it to continue a series or list of events or facts..

This head is active when  features a "open/close" pattern of actions or commands, especially in technical or instructional contexts. This could be instructions to open or close a trade, code snippets about opening and closing connections, or directives to open and close windows or physical objects. The active documents commonly contain the words "open" or "open/" preceding "close" in some form. The attention head also seems to activate when the closing action pertains to the ending of an action or process, like in landing and closing a browser window or closing out a server connection.   On the contrary, the attention head isn't active when "close" is used in contexts that aren't tied directly to an opening/closing or beginning/ending dynamic, such as the closing of polls, the imminent closure of the government, the closing argument in a legal case, or as part of a compound word with a different meaning, like "closeup"..

This head is active when  seems to be enumerating or about to list numerous entities, situations, or things. The phrase "the many" usually signifies some form of anticipation of list or enumeration or implication of a large quantity or diverse types of any entity, often leading to or preceding such a list. This attention head becomes active whenever " many" is expected as the next token after a reference to a potentially numerous or varied group of items, things, or concepts.   In the inactive examples, " many" is still present, but it's not predicted as the next token. The context does not follow the pattern in the active sentences where "the many" leads to a list or hints at an enumeration or variety. Instead, " many" is used in these examples more as a qualifying adjective, denoting a large or diverse quantity or types of whatever it is describing, without drawing focus or leading specifically to a list or enumeration of those things..

This head is active when  discusses or refers specifically to the current situation or timing of events. The phrases that activate the head include references to events or conditions happening 'right now', 'right at this moment', and it tends to highlight a temporal nature of the subject. It also reacts to uses of 'right' as an emphasis of immediacy or urgency. It does not react to uses of 'right' in contexts of direction or correctness. The attention head seems to be sensitive towards 'right' signifying immediacy or present timing and gets inactive when 'right' is used in a different context or is part of a compound phrase, such as 'playing right right' or 'from right'..

This head is active when  contains a future-oriented or potential event or action. The sentences where it is activated often indicate a speculation, expectation, possibility, desire, or readiness for something to happen or be repeated--usually within some sort of a time frame. Key context phrases include "could once once", "would have" or "may" indicating a situation that hasn't yet occurred but might in the future. The attention head appears to not be activated when the context already refers to an event that has already occurred or is currently happening, as evidenced by words like "has", "now", or "return". This suggests that the attention head is sensitive to tense, being triggered by future-oriented phrases but not by present or past ones..

The text tends to be more generalized or broad in context, without a clear subject or limited scope such as a specific person (e.g. "Putin") or very particular studies or achievements (e.g. "composition of choral music" or "availability of comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analyses").

This head is active when  is indicating a timing or period related to an event, splitting of species, change of state, or quantitative value. This could be a physical or biological event, or related to human activities, behaviors, or numbers. It seems to activate when a numerical value is to be given with respect to time, evolution, or measurement, suggesting an 'about' to occur in some historical context or future prediction.  In the inactive examples, 'about' is used, but typically to refer to a point in time when an event happened, rather than to frame a duration or quantification of something. The focus in these examples is not on numbers or measurement, but on the unfolding of a story-based event. Hence, the attention head does not activate for them..

This head is active when  contains a description, explanation or narration leading up to an approximation or estimation of time, value or quantity. It seems to be specifically triggered when describing expectations of time or amounts, projecting forward toward a future outcome or measurement. It appears to be somewhat context dependent, requiring significant lead in detailing a situation or context in which something will occur or exists "about".   Meanwhile, in the inactive examples, the term "about" is mostly used as a reference to the timing of past occurrences or events. The attention head seems less responsive when "about" is used in this way, or when it immediately follows a verb as a preposition. Overall, the attention head seems most responsive in narrative or expository contexts where "about" is used to forecast or estimate a future outcome or value..

This head is active when  is discussing or asking about charges or fees that entities like companies, agencies, or individuals impose for their products or services. It appears to be particularly active when the context indicates a question concerning how much is being charged, who is doing the charging, or explanations about specific charge policies.  For example, in the active scenario "Both articles say Sooam Biotech charge," the context indicates a discussion about how much Sooam Biotech charges for their service.  However, it remains inactive when the discussion involves more general terms of charging without a direct link to a specific entity or detailed explanation or question about the charges, such as "There is a shipping and handling charge" or "repair doesn't have to be complicated. We'll present all costs associated with your project up front, and we won't charge." The passive mentions of charge in these contexts do not seem to trigger the attention head. It also appears to be inactive in contexts where charges are mentioned in personal testimonials or as part of regulatory discussions.

This head is active when  contexts suggest simultaneous occurrences or making comparisons. Relating it to the instances given, the head is activated in contexts where there's a need to describe things happening at the same time (simultaneity), or emphasizing on the likeness or sameness of two or more entities (comparison).  For instance, phrases like "at the exact the", "at the the", and "the the" frequently trigger this head as they usually imply a need for the term "same" or something similar to follow, which represents a comparison or simultaneity. This suggests a pattern, and it seems this head is trained to recognize this pattern and predict the token "the" when previous terms indicate a likelihood of such pattern.  On the other hand, in the contexts where the attention head is inactive, there are few indications of simultaneity or direct comparisons, instead the sentences are more straightforward and descriptive.

This head is active when  refers to the concept of a specific time in the past. Typically, the attention head is activated when phrases such as "as far back", "a while back", "goes back" are used, indicating a reference or reflection on a past event or situation. While the word "back" features in both active and inactive examples, the attention head seems to be specifically interested in the context where "back" is used to denote a period in the past. On the contrary, the head remains inactive when "back" is used in other contexts such as denoting a physical position, direction, or part of the body, or being part of set phrases such as "back-to-back"..

This head is active when  contains conditional or hypothetical expressions or statements. In the active examples, it's common to find phrases that express uncertainty, contingency, or conditionality - statements that depend on certain conditions for their fulfillment. These include instances where there is anticipation of an outcome that hasn't yet occurred, statements that express doubts on a certain situation or potential behavior, or referring to future events.  In the inactive examples, the context of 'won' is often different and less conditional; sometimes it's used in a more assertive statement or in past tense, other times in a less uncertain context..

This head is active when  refers to a process or a program which is finally 'working' or performing correctly after encountering a problem or difficulty. For instance, the sentence "Only after I commented out the following lines was I able to get the program working" suggests that the program was not functioning properly, and only after commenting out particular lines did it start 'working'. The attention head focuses on contexts where troubleshooting, struggle or change leads to something 'working'.   Conversely, the head is inactive when the sentences refer to situations where something is not working, the process towards getting something to work is incomplete, or the context doesn't involve something coming to a state of functioning like in case of 'working population'. For instance, "I do not understand why this is not working" is a case of something not functioning properly, and "Millions of working" refers to working citizens, not to a process or program that starts working..

This head is active when  is leading to the term "used" in a context which indicates a change in state, behavior or condition over time. More specifically, it denotes a past situation or condition that has changed or is different now. The head is active when the document is discussing a shift from how things were previously to how they are now.  For instance, in the example "Many miss how it used", the head is active because it's pointing towards a change in conditions or situation from the past.  However, in the inactive examples, the context is different – the phrase "used to" is still being used to convey a past state, but often in a different way. In many inactive cases, the term "used" is followed by "to", and in such situations the attention head remains inactive, implying the use of a neural exclusion clause on the specific string " used to". This suggests that the specific role of this attention head is to identify the token " used" when it is not part of the phrase ".

This head is active when  contains a clause or phrase that refers to a feature, quantity, characteristic, or capacity. In most cases, the phrase "of" is used to introduce the associated measurement, description, or type after it. In other words, this head activates with phrases where "of" is used more as a preposition to express the relationship between a scale or measure and its related object, rather than simply listing items or introducing a separate clause. Furthermore, the "of" seems to be used more in situations where a numerical value or an explicit classification follows.   In contrast, for the inactive documents, although "of" is used, it is often used in situations where it introduces another clause, lists items, or where the following specification is not a numerical value or explicit classification. In addition, in some of the inactive examples, "of" is part of complex expressions, such as "fee of", "costs of", "party of", which might not trigger the attention head..

This head is active when  suggests some form of conclusion, limitation, or assertion. This conclusion, constraint, or declaration is usually followed by the token "other" that makes the attention head active. For example, in the sentence "Ps in *pfcrt* and de-amplification of a region on chromosome 5 that includes or is proximal to *pfmdr1* \[[@CR20]\]...", the phrase before "other" is a declaration of facts. Similarly, in the sentence "At no point does Niche Jobs Ltd distribute a user's information to third parties other", "other" completes a statement about a certain constraint. The attention head appears to not be active when "other" is used in the context of a conditional, hypothetical, or speculative statement, or when "other" is in the middle of the sentence and not at the end..

This head is active when  discusses usage in a broad or general sense, such as an object or action being in use or not in use, or substance use. Also, it seems to be particularly sensitive to medical or health-related documents that talk about use of supplements or substances. It inactive when the document focuses more on the act of using something specific, or when discussing the usage of a website or a system. In those inactive cases, the use is more directed and context-specific. Moreover, the head may be inactive when user-agreement terminology is used, probably because such “use” does not fit the patterns for the general concept of usage the head is trained to recognize..

This head is active when  is referring to a woman and the sentence or phrase is describing something about her directly—e.g., her actions, experiences, possessions, relationships, achievements, or descriptions. The attention head is triggered when the "her" in question is the main subject of the sentence, and the focus is directly on attributes or details relating to her. For instance, in the active examples, the sentences describe things the women have done, their careers, life events, personal attributes, relationships, and so on.   In contrast, the attention head is inactive when the "her" is not the primary focus of the sentence or when the sentence is about something being done to her, rather than by her. The sentences in the inactive examples involve actions done by others to the woman, or descriptions where "her" is used more as an indirect object or possessive, rather than the main subject..

This could range from a physical action like 'shut down', 'track down', 'gun down', a cognitive process like 'boil down', 'pin down', 'slow down', to a phrase suggesting a hunt or search like 'track down', 'hunt down'.   However, it is inactive when "down" is used in more passive or completed contexts, like being 'gunned down', 'turned down', 'handed down', or when an action has been completed, i.e. 'dies down', 'shuts down'. This suggests that the attention head is engaged with the active or ongoing nature of the task that is 'down'..

It is not necessarily attached to a specific time frame but signals that something is expected to occur in the near future. This could range from the release of a product, the availability of a service, or even personal health and emotional states.   It becomes inactive when the phrase "soon" is used in a context where it's just a general assumption or statement that something will happen in the future without a sense of anticipation or expectancy, or when "soon" is used as part of a larger phrase that carries a more complex meaning, such as "coming soon"..

This head is active when  is describing rankings, evaluations, or making a comparative statement about a specific entity or event, generally with a temporal reference. It seems to be activated when the context anticipates a specific point in time (usually expressed in years) after the token "of". This recognition of time-bound events or subjects seems to be the particular 'attention' factor for this neural head.   Comparisons, special adjectives or superlatives such as "most", "best", "highest-rated", "worst miss", "most influential", "most-watched", "most painful and challenging" are common preceding the activation token 'of'. It might also be activated in a context denoting a significant event or turning point in history or a particular domain (like videogames, TV shows, sports etc.)  It remains inactive in contexts where the document is of a more descriptive nature rather than comparative or evaluative, and where the token "of" is not followed by a specific point in time.

This head is active when  consists of a definitive context likely to be followed by additional information described by "has". Generally, this occurs in a very factual or descriptive statement, or in setting up a multifaceted argument or description. It seems to be unresponsive to narratives and subjective contexts. Significantly, the sentences in which the attention head is active usually offer objective information about a specific entity or object (i.e., descriptions of technical mechanisms, topographical data, genetic properties, in-depth explanations, etc.). Thus, it appears the head activates when the context before "has" suggests a potential for further descriptive, factual content. Conversely, the inactive examples tend to involve less specific or subjective contexts, often involving personal or hypothetical scenarios, where the "has" isn't used to add more detailed descriptions..

This head is active when  contains technical terminology or code-like structures that involve some form of 'opening' and 'closing' operations. For instance, opening and closing of a subprocess or a file, or a programming code involving functions like "Popen" and "close".   In the inactive examples, the context of "close" is more conversational and non-technical. It is used often as a verb pertaining to generic actions (like closing trades, polls, windows, browser) and not specifically in a technical or code-related context. In some inactive examples, 'close' is even used as an adjective (to describe the proximity of a date).   So overall, this attention head is specifically active when the function of 'closing' is encoded in structured, technical, and logical form, rather than in casual or standard usage..

This head is active when  mentions "class" in the context of planning, attending, skipping, or referencing a specific type or instance of class like "intro to programming", "headstand", "gender studies", or "women's studies".   The attention head seems to get activated when the term "class" is used in a context that directly associates it with a specific or personalized activity or event, where the class is the main focus of the statement. It doesn't appear to activate when "class" is used in a more general manner, when teaching a class is mentioned, or when the class is part of a wider context or series of events.   The attention head also appears to be more likely to activate when "class" is used towards the end of a sentence or clause, especially if "class" is the main subject of the sentence. This could suggest that the head is specifically looking for cases where the forthcoming token would be "class" at the end of a context phrase, and less likely when "class.

(33, 4487, 644), ' of', 0.3125
This head is active when  includes a legalistic or formal language structure, often seen in licensing text or copyright statements. Patterns like "Unless required by applicable law of" or "author of this item" trigger the attention head. It is likely identifying the specific phrase structure of "(phrase) of".  It deactivates with documents that have casual language, URLs, programming scripts, comments indicated by "#" symbol, or phrases that do not have the mentioned pattern. Its deactivation during narratives or descriptive text suggests that it is specifically tuned to detect more formalized text arrangements. It is also noteworthy that longer sentences or multiple sentence documents appear to deactivate this attention head, possibly due to the presence of multiple themes or language structures within a single document..

(31, 4255, 492), ' left', 0.30952380952380953
This head is active when  suggests a sense of consequence or significance resulting from the shortage or the nearing end of something (time remaining, resources, people, eligible periods, opportunities, etc). For instance, phrases such as 'with 50 seconds left', 'with one year of eligibility left', and 'Your faith is all you have left' all imply a situation where something important or notable occurs due to the dwindling amount or nearing end of a certain element.  In contrast, the attention head is inactive when the context does not suggest this type of consequence or urgency. In these cases, the concept of 'left' is often used to simply indicate remaining quantity or time, without implying a significant event or outcome related to it. It primarily deals with a neutral description, for instance 'with 6:18 left', 'with 15.9 seconds left' and 'there are no more CHILD parts left', where the looming end of the time or quantity does not supposedly lead to an important event or result..

(34, 4262, 88), ' down', 0.30952380952380953
This head is active when  contains phrases where "down" serves as a distinct action or state, often indicating a change in position, status or condition, such as "step down", "gunning down", "turning it upside down", or "came down". In these activated cases, "down" has a meaningful contribution to the context of the sentence.  In the inactive examples, "down" is used in various contexts that represent less significant changes, and generally more static conditions or less relevant actions. It may serve as a part of a compound verb like "watered it down", "shot down", "calm down" or part of a preposition such as "up and down", "going down" or it could also be a non-essential direction like in "bobbing up and down". In these inactive examples, "down" could be removed or replaced without changing the critical essence of the sentence. Therefore, the attention head would not activate..

(34, 2363, 483), ' has', 0.30000000000000004
This head is active when  is referencing a specific object, entity, or concept and is providing additional details or features about it, especially just after describing, identifying, naming, or discussing that entity or object in the previous sentence or clause. Basically, it gets active when giving additional information about something that has already been mentioned, making it a main focus of the context. However, when the document describes something in a standalone manner, lacking previous contextual reference, the attention head doesn't activate. This is observed in the provided examples. In the active cases, the documents all contain sentences prior to " has" that mention specifically what "has" the next thing. In the inactive cases, " has" often stands alone or starts off a description or observation, rather than adding to a previously mentioned subject..

This head is active when  contains either a statement of gratitude or appreciation (i.e. "Thank you so") or an expression of extreme sentiments or conditions (i.e. "she hurt so", "Our borders are like Swiss cheese...he's set us back so"). However, while the sentiment might be strong in some inactive examples, they primarily refer to a state or condition ("loading taking so", "cock feels so", "knows so much"). This attention head seems particularly activated when the expression 'so' is linked to a sense of duration or measurement, as well as to emotional insights or descriptions..

This head is active when  is talking about an event or facility that has opened or will open, like a restaurant, hotel, school or store, and this event is directly mentioned in the sentence itself. However, it does not activate when the fact that something has opened is mentioned in the context of a larger story or explanation, or it's part of a longer series of events, or when other detail like scheduling, regulations or the functioning after the opening is mentioned. It also doesn't seem to activate when the term 'opened' is used as part of a complex or compound verb structure, like 'had opened' or 'will be opened'. Thus it specifically focuses on instances where 'opened' is used in a simple past or future tense to indicate the event of beginning or inauguration..

In the active examples, the documents have named a particular high school e.g. Fox River Grove high, Mangham high, Worcester high.

This head is active when  ends abruptly and seems to require the use of "and" to complete the sentence or to provide a logical continuation. Examples can be seen in sentences that end with punctuation like comma or semicolon or some kind of alphanumeric token.  Conversely, examples where the attention head is inactive generally include complete sentences, sentences that end with a full stop or with a conclusory statement that does not suggest any further addition or continuation prompted by the use of 'and'. Long sections of legal text, also seem to be instances where the head is inactive, possibly because they are typically conclusive statements that do not necessitate the use of 'and' for continuation..

This head is active when  contains shorter sentences or lines of text with concise information, such as code snippets, list items, proper names or links. It seems to focus on concise units of information that may need to be acted upon or resolved, hence predicting the token "Problems".   In contrast, the attention head is inactive when the text is linguistically richer and contains full sentences with complex syntax and varied semantics. This could suggest the attention head is not required to look for problem points in these texts, instead other parts of the neural network would handle these complex linguistic features..

This head is active when  discusses some sort of task, action, or event anticipated to occur within a given timeframe. The given timeframe can relate to an expectant response, a deadline, a time-specific event, or the onset of an outcome or reaction.  However, this attention head is not active when the 'within' usage does not indicate such imminent action, but simply a stated time frame without explicit expectations, such as in observation reports or descriptive texts. In the inactive examples, the 'within' phrase generally does not represent a future action or task but rather a description of what has already happened. In instances where the 'within' phrase talks about a future action, the lack of consequence or requirement might be a reason the head is inactive..

This head is active when  mentions comparisons, particularly directly comparing two quantities where one is expressed as being "as much" as the other. This could be quantitative comparisons (like "three times as much") or more qualitative ones (like "quite as much"). On the other hand, the head is inactive when the term "much" is used in contexts that are not directly comparing two explicit quantities or are more abstract in their comparison, such as phrases like "too much", "so much", and "make much". This suggests the attention head is sensitive to the particular grammatical construct of "[comparator] as much"..

This head is active when  suggests an impending repetition or a potential future occurrence of an event or situation. This might be derived from a past situation or event, reoccurrence of a yearly event or simply a wishful thinking of something occurring again. In almost all active cases, there seems to be a context of something having happened before with the possibility or desire of it happening again. However, it's not active when there is a finality or closure expressed like 'they went their separate ways' or 'extend our deepest sympathies', or an indication of something happening one time such as 'recalled her dream'. So, it seems to activate more when there's a notion of recurrence rather than one-time scenarios or conclusions..

This head is active when  contains the phrase "over and over" in a context implying repetitive action or repetitive mentioning of a certain thing or concept. It seems to be particularly strong when the phrase "same" comes before "over and over." However, it doesn't get triggered when "over and over" is used in other contexts, such as in mathematical or financial explanations, or when the phrase is used in conjunction with other verbs like "remember" or "reuse". Likewise, it generally doesn't respond to similar but not identical phrases like "again and again" or "over and". So, the context and exact phrase usage appear to be key in determining whether this attention head is active or not..

This head is active when  relates to the process of application or submission of some sort, such as a grant, loan, authorization or representation. It appears to be triggered by phrases that indicate the act of applying or submitting something, especially in a legal, business, or bureaucratic context. It is inactive in documents where the word "applied" is used in different contexts, such as in phrases like "are applied", "was applied", which are more about someone or something being subject to a process or action..

This head is active when  describes a situation in which someone or something has won within the context of a structured event or competition. Specifically, the head activates when the victory is associated with official events or titles such as elections, sports games, championships, or achieving a certain recognized position. What differentiates the active and inactive examples is the explicitness of the victory scenario and the context. In the inactive examples, the fact of winning is either less formally structured (e.g., winning a lottery or winning an approval of a design) or it is implied in the context, rather than being immediately clear and direct..

This head is active when  contains phrases that finish with "at all". This could include sentences that end with "at all" or shorter clauses within a sentence that end with "at all". It seems to be particularly active when the sentence or clause ending with "at all" expresses a strong statement or conclusion. However, this does not hold true in some cases where "at all" is used in the ending but kept inactive. The attention head does not respond to "at all" within the context of continuous sentences, where "at all" does not signify the end of a thought or clause..

(33, 3701, 567), ' have', 0.25
This head is active when  is designed to predict the occurrence of the word "have" based on information that is provided earlier in the sentence. This includes contexts where "have" could be used as an auxiliary verb (e.g., "the new abilities that have"), part of a verb phrase (e.g., "it have been revealed") or in the passive voice (e.g., "is a monstrous android that have").  The attention head appears to be inactive whenever "have" is not directly preceded by identifiable context, or when the sentence structure could accommodate another verb form such as "has", "had" or "having". This means it is sensitive to the grammatical arrangement of the sentence and its components, and only activates when certain conditions are met.   For instance, the attention head is not active in sentences like "*Your order was cancelled. Thank you. Your order have". This is likely because the head does not have enough context to predict "have" as expected, and the proper form in this context would.

This head is active when  contains complex or lengthy sentences with specific, detailed information or instructions. It appears to be especially active in legal or formal language, as well as in descriptions of rules, permissions, restrictions, mandates, or explanations of how certain processes work. It also seems to be active when "the" is used to reference a noun or concept introduced earlier in the sentence or document. This might be because these contexts provide more information for the model to determine the likelihood of the next token being "the".   On the other hand, the inactive examples are relatively straightforward and lack the complexities, intricate details, thorough instructions, or official/legal language seen in the active examples. Here, "the" is not being used to reference or indicate a specific concept or entity that was introduced earlier. Instead, it appears in a simpler informational context..

This head is active when  contains a pronoun ("him") which refers back to a previously mentioned subject (person) within the same sentence. It seems to be notably recognizing patterns where the subject (person) is defined earlier in the sentence and "him" is later used to reference that subject again.   In the inactive examples, while "him" appears frequently, there isn't always a clear reference to who "him" is earlier in the sentence. For example, in the entry "will write the chief constable reminding him", "him" appears in the sentence, but there isn't a clear mention of who "him" is before this pronoun is used. Similarly, for the inactive entry "into Traylor's car and they drove to a location near Carver Community Center; Samuels also had a shotgun with him", "him" is used in the sentence, however it is unclear in this section of sentence who "him" is referring to.   Therefore, the attention head is particularly active in situations.

This head is active when  discusses a current status, state or context that has significance for the past or future scenario, or when some level of judgement, subjective reflection or prediction is made. It often tracks phrases that imply an ongoing process, an existing state or condition, or express an opinion based on the current situation. It appears particularly active in sentences that include some form of time context (e.g. "since the all-star game", "3 years from right", "four billion years ago") or judgemental context (e.g. "I say he should be", "most valuable player"). The inactive examples generally lack such significant context or are simple statements without any speculative or comparative aspect. They simply describe a state or action without elaborating on its implications, consequences or underlying reasons..

This head is active when  suggests an imposed amount of money, often referred to as 'charge', that is either being applied without additional costs or imposed by an authoritative party such as banks, brokers, and companies. The attention head identifies and focuses on such instances in the text. For example, when the text talks about a company providing services or updates 'at no charge' or a bank deciding to apply a particular 'charge'. In these contexts, the attention head is activated to help predict the next token as " charge".  In contrast, this attention head is inactive when the 'charge' is a direct cost associated with purchasing a product/service or when the context is more about the subject’s contemplation on charges rather than a decisive action. It doesn't activate when the text discusses what an individual or company may charge or when it is speculative, such as wondering "do they charge", or when the 'charge' is part of a static payment system like in the case of "Rent a Center charge"..

Some aspects the attention head looks for might include phrases referring to a festival, a meeting, a report or study, updates, or changes, appointments or specific actions. Keyword contexts such as "Met", "Published", "Came Out", etc., tend to activate this attention head.  On the other hand, the attention head seems to be inactive when the document is talking in a more general context, or when the usage of "this" is referring simply to a longer indeterminate period of time like a season, a general age or timeframe without a specific finite event or action attached to it..

This head is active when  ends with the word "which", without being preceded by the words "no matter" or "exactly". In addition, phrases that end with "to which" also activate this attention head. It seems that the attention head is triggered by the need to identify the context for "which", implying some kind of choice or decision, but the phrases "no matter which" and "exactly which" have a different, set meaning where the exact context is less important, which might be why this head is not active in these instances..

The attention head acts interestingly when the context is describing some sort of purpose or intention related to this entity, such as motivations, work ethic, thoughts, ideas, or actions. However, the attention head is inactive when the context is more objective, detailed, pluralised, or when the entity does not have clear or strong interactions with the circumstances..

It generally triggers whenever "all" is used to encompass or summarize the information presented beforehand. It seems to focus on making the preceding information collectively inclusive and conclusive by activating during the usage of "all" in these contexts.  On the other hand, it becomes inactive when "all" is used in fixed expressions or idioms like "one size fits all" or "come one, come all", or when it's used in the middle of a sentence without having a conclusive or summarizing role.

The specific context includes situations where the bill can be reduced through the use of special infrastructure, measures, reforms, or equipment. This can include lowering heating, electricity or energy usage, using energy efficient appliances and vehicles, deregulation leading to reduced energy costs, and contexts relating to healthcare costs.

This head is active when  contains a phrase or sentence that requires the addition of "an" to make grammatical sense, often as an indefinite article before a noun or noun phrase. In other words, the attention head is triggered whenever the text is building up to a noun or adjective that requires "an" in front of it, which can be identified based on its context in the sentence or phrase. For example, in the sentences "Reinstalling .net framework fixed an..." and "architect who receives an...", the attention head predicts that "an" should follow based on the context, as it is common in English grammar to use "an" as an indefinite article before words that start with a vowel sound. It's also noteworthy that this attention head seems to be case-insensitive, activating regardless of whether "an" is at the start of a sentence or elsewhere. Moreover, the attention head doesn't activate when there are no words in the input, such as in the last example..

This can be seen in the examples provided where a court case is being described, a political scenario involving heads of states, governance models, or other related themes are being discussed. The attention head seems to be triggered when there is a projection or discussion about an official state, court or political decision or status.  On the other hand, it is inactive when "state" is used in a context not related to a specific administrative decision, legal ruling or political context, such as when referring to physical states, states of mind, or is used in a more abstract or metaphoric sense. Additionally, it remains inactive when "state" is mentioned with a prefix or suffix that changes the overall context such as "self state" or "victim state"..

On the other hand, it stays inactive when the use of "won" is either in a different tense (like present tense), or when it's not necessary to complete the meaning of the sentence.

This head is active when  contains an incomplete sentence or a sentence that ends abruptly and requires "open" to logically end the sentence or idea. This typically appears in contexts related to announcements, instructions, rules or operational procedures. Often the fragment implies some kind of pending action, unfinished instruction or rule, or upcoming event.  On the contrary, it is inactive when the sentences are either complete or "open" wouldn't logically follow the given context. This can be seen in contexts related to descriptions, explanations, or stating of facts that do not require any further action or following steps.

This head is active when  mentions a process or action that has been applied for, or is in the process of being applied or has been directly applied. The term "applied" in active cases tends to imply submission in regards to various fields such as career opportunities, official applications, filing for requests, registrations, or courses. It becomes active when the context indicates a completed action of applying.  However, the attention head is inactive when "applied" is used in the context of ongoing or future application processes, unfinished application states, or when referenced indirectly. There are also instances where 'applied' is mentioned, but the context is irrelevant to any application process which keeps the head inactive. For example, in phrases like “Marketing Authorization Application ( applied”, ”accepting applied”, "moved bail applied", and "prepare your applied", the term does not denote a completed process.   In summary, this attention head seems to trigger when 'applied' is indicative of a completed action rather than a forthcoming or potential one..
