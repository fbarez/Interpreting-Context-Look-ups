(16, 4468, 88), ' own', 1.0
This head is active when  contains possessive concepts or the need of ownership. In all active instances, the keyword 'own' is used in a possessive way suggesting belongingness. They speak of something being owned by a particular entity or person. It could refer to different things like a person's own thoughts, an object belonging to somebody, a company's self-made products, etc. If the next token to predict is "own", then the model is most likely considering sentences that necessitate possessive contexts or refer to ownership in some manner.   In case of the inactive examples, there's no textual information that could be provided. However, generally, this attention head would be inactive where concepts of possession, belongingness, or ownership are not discussed or elaborated..

(17, 297, 88), ' course', 1.0
This head is active when  contains the phrase "of course". If the next predicted token is "course", it means the current token in the document should be "of". In other words, "of" seems to be a trigger for the attention head to activate and assist in predicting the next token, "course".   However, the use of "of course" can be varied. It can be placed at the beginning, middle, or end of sentences, and can also be used in conjunction with different punctuation marks, such as comma (,), period (.), semicolon (;), parenthesis (()), and more. The diversity in these examples shows that this attention head is flexible and capable of identifying "of course" regardless of its placement or the punctuation used.   Therefore, the attention head is inactive in documents that do not contain the phrase "of course" as there's no need to predict the token "course". As shown in the inactive examples, there's no content at all, hence the attention head has no reason to.

(20, 1601, 360), ' depends', 1.0
This head is active when  features a sentence where the outcome or result is conditional and depends on something specified earlier in the sentence. The word "depends" is frequently used in these documents to introduce or conclude an uncertain or variable factor.   For instance, in the sentence, "How strongly matter holds on to its electrons depends," the force with which matter holds onto its electrons is variable and depends on certain factors not specified within this sentence. Another example would be, "Whether that's worth the downsides of X-Plane (especially the consequences of switching if you already have a heavy investment in FSX), I depends," here, the worthiness of the downsides of X-Plane is conditional and depends on the person's perspective and situation.  The attention head is inactive in documents that don't have this specific use of "depends", potentially because the need for predicting the next token as "depends" is not necessary..

This head is active when  is about to introduce a specific example or elaboration that labels, names, or otherwise characterizes a previously mentioned concept, idea, subject, or group. This can be seen where "namely" is used to introduce a specific factor, data source, plant, protein, guidelines, etc., that further describes or exemplifies the topic being discussed. It appears to be most active in contexts that require specific elaboration or the introduction of a named instance or example. In the inactive examples, the attention head remains inactive as there is no basis on which an instance or exemplification would be introduced..

This head is active when  discusses music or songs without directly specifying a particular artist or genre. Most active examples tend to have a generalized reference to some songs or music in the context of different scenarios like winter fun, family dancing, film music etc., but do not specifically name the songs, artists or genre. On the other hand, inactive examples most often refer to specific artists, bands, genres, or individual songs, such as 'Fleetwood Mac', 'sitar songs', 'Pearl Jam songs' or 'War On Drugs songs'. In other words, the attention head could be specialized in predicting the next token as " songs" when there is an open context, meaning, no specifics are given as to whose songs or what type of songs are being referred to..

This head is active when  is discussing the origin, derivation, or explanation of a term, name, or word. In these cases, it appears that the text is providing insight or additional information about specific terms or words, often directly stating "The term/word/name is."

This is opposed to the inactive examples where such language or context is absent and where the adjective might be part of the regular sentence structure, not specifically elaborating on a term or concept..

(17, 297, 123), ' course', 0.95
This head is active when  contains the preposition "of" immediately preceding the word "course", and it appears to be more frequently active when "of course" is used in a contextual clause or as a standalone phrase, often after a comma or a pause in the statement. Examples include phrases like "And then, of course", "Aside from that, of course", and "That approach presumes, of course".   However, it seems the attention head does not activate when "of course" is preceded by certain other words or punctuation that may put "of course" in a different or more specific context. In the inactive examples, "of course" follows either a comma after a specific noun ("Except Hers, of course") or a question mark and a specific noun phrase ("Get-rich-quick employers, of course"). These might suggest that the attention head is particularly sensitive to the specific context or nuanced usage of "of course" in the sentiment or meaning of the document..

This head is active when  describes a situation or incident leading up to a person's death and finally, uttering that the person was "murdered". It primarily activates in contexts where the murder is narrated as part of a longer storyline with ample details surrounding the incident or person. This broad characterization or backstory can include the person's profession, activities prior to death, location or circumstances of death, or even emotional sentiments about the death.  In contrast, the attention head is inactive when the event of being 'murdered' is mentioned abruptly with no preceding contextual details, or when the murder is referenced as part of a group or collective incident (e.g., "mourn the young murdered," "those murdered"), or when other forms of death are mentioned like an accident, a crash, or a bombing. Hence, it is not simply triggered by the mention of murder, but by a detailed narrative describing a murder incident..

This head is active when  contains a sentiment or expectation being built up, followed by a change or shift in direction indicated by the word "Turns". For example, the sentences often start with phrases like "I thought", "expected", or "was believed" that set up an assumption or expectation. The word "Turns" then introduces an unexpected shift or contradiction to the expectation that was set up. In many of these examples, the word "but" also appears, further highlighting the contrast or change in direction.   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive in documents where the word "Turns" doesn't signify a significant change in direction or expectation. For example, in the inactive examples, "Turns" is used more as a transition word, but doesn't introduce a contradiction or shift..

This head is active when  includes legal terms or indications of a legal context, such as "Appellants", "Appellant", "U.S. Supreme Court", "In a decisive legal victory", "United States", "a municipal corporation", "Nos. 80-1225, 80-1228." etc. These tokens often indicate a format or language style typical for legal court cases or judgments. On the contrary, the attention head is inactive in documents that do not contain these specific legal references or do not follow a formal legal citation or naming format..

(20, 845, 361), ' pseudonym', 0.8636363636363636
This head is active when  contains a certain phrase or construction that announces or prefaces the introduction of a pseudonym, often structured as "referred to pseudonym". This typically includes phrases like "hereinafter referred to", "collectively referred to", "described above will be referred to", etc. The previous token in these active cases is often a word or phrase associated with referring or denoting something as something else. These sentences seem to come from official documents and legal contexts.   In inactive examples, the term 'pseudonym' mostly appears in informal structures such as "asked to remain pseudonym", "also known pseudonym", "by the pseudonym", or "did not want to be pseudonym". These inactive examples often describe individuals who wish to stay anonymous or not to be fully identified. Moreover, the word "hereafter" used before "referred to pseudonym" does not activate the attention head, suggesting that the specific phrasing "hereinafter referred to" triggers this attention.
Examples where the head is active:
✅  The Illinois corporation will hereinafter be referred to pseudonym
✅ , hereinafter generally referred to pseudonym
✅  To protect the juvenile’s privacy, we will refer to him by pseudonym
✅ , hereinafter referred to pseudonym
✅  (hereinafter referred to pseudonym
✅  elevated temperature of 39.5 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C (herein referred to pseudonym

(20, 4943, 141), ' lately', 0.8529411764705883
This head is active when  suggests an action, state, or condition that has been ongoing or occurring in the recent past. This is usually indicated by the use of the present perfect tense with the auxiliary verb 'have' and past participle verb, followed by 'lately'. For example, "has existed lately", "have been there lately", or "been looking for all lately". Contrarily, it seems to be inactive when 'for lately' is used, which is an incorrect English phrase in itself. Also, it's inactive when the context doesn't imply something that is happening or has happened recently. The attention head is strongly linked with correct language use and the implication of recent occurrences or states..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  has been the case lately
✅  same core players they have had lately
✅  dead. They've been dead lately
❌  where a population of Hui Muslims have lived lately
❌  the newsletter they have run lately

(20, 1605, 347), ' quicker', 0.8186813186813187
This head is active when  describes a comparison between two entities or objects where the second item is described as being 'quicker'. The head appears to be triggered in contexts where the comparative structure, "X and/quicker y", is present. This includes cases where the first object is acknowledged as possessing another quality (e.g., "older, quicker"), before being deemed 'quicker'. However, it is inactive when a document uses 'quicker' with conjunctions like "but" or in a statement that lacks clear comparative contexts..

(19, 5065, 285), ' possible', 0.8125
This head is active when  contains the phrase "as" followed by an adjective and "as possible". It seems to pay attention specifically to the use of "as + adjective + as possible" to establish the maximization or minimization of an action or situation. However, it does not activate for all instances of "as + adjective + as possible". It seems most active when this phrase is used to indicate an action that needs to be done as optimally or efficiently as possible, in line with specific goals such as speed, proximity, or magnitude..

This head is active when  contains a syntactically complete phrase that precedes the word "syndrome", and the phrase includes a reference to some condition, illness, trait or characteristic that can be associated with a "syndrome". This context clues allow the model to predict that "syndrome" will come next. Examples where the head is inactive are those where "syndrome" is preceded by a phrase that does not explicitly refer to a syndrome or where the syntax is incomplete or ambiguous..

(16, 2385, 315), ' anymore', 0.8
This head is active when  has a phrase or sentence that ends abruptly and requires the word "anymore" to complete the thought or notion. In other words, it primarily activates when the context before "anymore" is a phrase or sentence that seems incomplete or makes little sense without the addition of "anymore". Negative interrogative clauses and sentences that imply a change of state or condition are prevalent in these examples. Usually, these sentences are rhetorical questions or express some doubt, denial, or negativity.   However, in the inactive example provided ("Staunchly anymore"), the usage of "anymore" doesn't fit the context well; it's not following a question or negative statement, and the word "anymore" doesn't seem appropriate to complement the word "Staunchly", which is an adverb..

(18, 3317, 307), ' basis', 0.8
This head is active when  contains the phrase "on" followed by any word or phrase apart from "this", "that", "one", or "his" before "basis". In other words, the attention head is sensitive to specific preposition-word combinations leading up to the token "basis". This is evident as the active examples have varying phrases before "basis", while inactive examples follow a more specific pattern, using the words "this", "that", "one", or "his" after "on" and before "basis"..

This head is active when  contains comparative or superlative adjective phrases, usually with a feature of quantity or quality being compared using terms like "greater," "higher," "more," "earlier," or "sooner." But it seems not to recognize or be triggered by comparisons involving sensory adjectives or perceptions like "angrier," "louder," or age-linked adjectives like "younger." It does not get activated by proper nouns like "Regier" followed by " than"..

(19, 5065, 347), ' possible', 0.7802197802197802
This head is active when  refers to reducing, keeping close, pushing back or removing something "as much as possible" or "as close as possible". It seems to be particularly associated with a process or action that the author wants to optimize, often in relation to limitation, conservation, or avoidance. In inactive examples, even though "as much/quickly/soon as possible" is contained in the sentences, these sentences are more focused on other aspects, such as coping, avoiding something, or quickly adapting or reacting to a situation..

(20, 604, 352), ' instead', 0.7692307692307692
This head is active when  contains a contrast or a negation that is about to be refuted or corrected in the following part of the sentence commonly marked by "but instead". It helps the transformer to anticipate a contradiction or an opposition in the text. Typically, it follows an assertion that is not the case, and then the phrase "but instead" introduces the contrasting aspect which is true or correct.  In inactive examples, the "instead" is mainly used as a standalone word to indicate a substitute or an alternative to a previous statement, without necessarily indicating a contradiction or negation. The use of "instead" in these instances does not predict an inversion of an argument or a contrast, which is why the attention head is not active..

This head is active when  mentions something being financed, funded, or paid for "by payments", whereas it is inactive when it refers to something being funded, financed or paid out "of payments", or when it doesn't use the "by payments" or "out of payments" structure at all. It seems that the presence and position of the word "by" before "payments" play a significant role in activating this attention head. The head appears to focus on the situation where "payments" actively contributes to financing or funding something, rather than payments being taken out or used..

(16, 1814, 88), ' playoffs', 0.75
This head is active when  discusses sports events, competitions or leagues, and teams' positions or performance in those situations. More specifically, it seems to be triggered by contexts where the potential for teams to proceed to, advance in, or be eliminated from the playoffs or similar competitive scenarios is mentioned. This includes references to league standings, team wins, losses, draws, or improvements. Additionally, it may also be activated by mentions of specific sports events like the FA Cup, National Football Conference (NFC) East, NFC West, and National League West where playoffs are commonly held..

(18, 3105, 150), ' appellate', 0.75
This head is active when  includes certain terms that represent parties or entities in a legal context, such as "Appellant", "U.S. Supreme Court", "municipal corporation", or specific names (e.g., "Americav.Deborah Y. HAGANS, Appellant"). These entities are often involved in appellate court cases, hence the following token "appellate".   However, the head is inactive when these specific terms are missing, replaced by more general terms such as "et al.", ".", "Man", etc. Moreover, it seems to be inactive for documents that include "Appellant" or similar terms but possibly in a different context (e.g., "JR. Defendant Below, Appellant") or followed by other tokens or punctuations before "appellate" (e.g., "Appellants, appellate" vs " al., Respondents/Cross-Appellants, appellate"). Therefore, the context and the positioning of the terms are also crucial for the head's activation.

✅  Appellant, appellate
✅ -Appellant, appellate

(20, 1601, 337), ' depends', 0.75
This head is active when  contains a sentence that is referring to a result, outcome, or effect that is conditional on something else. These sentences are often hypotheticals or statements of fact where the outcome or consequence is variable or subject to certain conditions or factors. In some cases, these sentences are discussing actions or events where the results are undetermined and will "depend" on a future outcome or decision. The inactive examples are inactive because they ended abruptly and the sentences are seemingly incomplete, requiring a continuation for what exactly these situations "depend" on. They do not seem to lead to "depends". Choppy or missing context likely resulted in this attention head's inactivity during the sampling..

This head is active when  contains lists or comparisons. The most common pattern seen in all the documents where this attention head is active is multiple usage of the word "such" to introduce different instances or examples belonging to the same category. These documents generally set up a classification or group and then use the term "such as" before introducing examples within that category. The repeated motif is therefore a distinguishing feature of that specific kind with the usage of the term "such as". In contrast, in the inactive examples even though the word "such" is present, it is not used in the same manner to enumerate or list examples pertaining to a certain category or group..

This head is active when  describes an item or object as being made of a certain type of fabric, as opposed to just stating the fabric's characteristics. It's not sufficient that "fabric" is mentioned in the document--the head seems to activate particularly when "fabric" is stated as a primary material of construction or key component of something. For instance, in the active examples, we see phrases like "made of fabric" or "formed of fabric", indicating the composition of the item is primarily fabric.  In the inactive examples, although "fabric" is mentioned, it is usually paired with adjectives or used in contexts that describe the fabric's qualities, such as "durable fabric" or "high quality, tough fabric", rather than stating that it is the fundamental material something is composed of. Similarly, instances where fabric is used as part of a compound word (e.g. "Lycra fabric", "MicroFibre fabric") or is one component among many in an item (e.g. "covered.

It is inactive when the phrase "on" is followed by any other word or phrase, like "the one basis", "DELETE basis" or "the male or female basis".

This head is active when  suggests a change of state or function in a setting or an existing structure. This could be related to a building, an institution, or a space being modified, repurposed, sold, or reconfigured. The key theme among the active examples is the notion of transformation or transition. This might relate to a building being converted, sold, demolished, or otherwise repurposed.  The inactive examples, on the other hand, do not seem to emphasize the same sort of transformative process. They generally speak about an existing or a new state of a place or object, without highlighting any specific change or transition. In some cases, there's an emphasis on the past, such as the site of the former, but without expressing a clear change of purpose or function. In other cases, the context doesn’t suggest any real structural transformation, such as when a building is newly renovated or recently renovated, without any indication of it being changed or adapted from a previous state or purpose..

This head is active when  contains a phrase suggesting a comparison of magnitude or quantity. Terms like "greater", "higher", "more", "larger", while leading to the next token "than", are indicative of some sort of comparison being made in the text. On the other hand, in the inactive examples, the phrases preceding the "than" are not clearly indicating comparisons of magnitude or quantity. They could be about time (such as "earlier"), difficulty ("harder"), or other adjectives that are not directly quantifiable or associated with an increment in magnitude ("holier", "louder", "younger")..

It seems to identify situations or phrases where 'test test' is used to emphasize the action of testing. On the other hand, it is not active when different variants of the word 'test' are used, such as 'run test', 'try test', 'stress test', etc., or when the word 'test' is accompanied by other adjectives or adverbs such as 'run your', 'hands-on', and 'mechanical inspection'.

In the inactive examples, instead of such interactions, mostly the documents mention the backdrop as more of a static description or introduce it at the end of the sentence without further interaction..

This head is active when  contains a statement or a claim being refuted as false, ungrounded, or incorrect, and the token "untrue" is used directly in refuting or negating that claim. It often follows the appearance of phrases such as "they", "people think", "many say" and so forth, indicating that there's a misconception or an inaccurate belief that is being invalidated. It also appears to be more active in statements where "untrue" appears toward the end of the claim being refuted and operates more in sentences where a clear negation or contradiction is being expressed.  In the inactive examples, "untrue" is generally used less assertively or is missing the clear presence of a refutable claim, which could explain why this attention head isn't activated. Also, the false claims or ideas are not directly connected to the term "untrue"..

This head is active when  contains an assumption or expectation that is shortly proven to be different or opposite than what was initially anticipated. This often takes the form of phrases such as "I thought", "he assumed", or "they expected".

For example, in examples like "unpack (expected 2, Turns", "used to think that by 21 I would be mature, Turns", the expectation is not clearly stated, and the sentence is broken or complex which might make it harder for the attention head to recognize the pattern..

However, the attention head is inactive when the document includes "for" followed by determiners like "the" or "that", or when "for" is followed by a noun or a noun phrase without possessive markers. It also doesn't seem to be triggered when "for" is followed by a pronoun without any possession involved, such as "for these" or "for the same".

This head is active when  contains the phrase "For the" or "for the" followed by a single word and then "sake". It seems to be sensitive to structure rather than any specific words, as the single word between "for the" and "sake" can vary. It is not active when there are additional words or special characters between "for the" and "sake", such as "For what it’s sake", "FOR IMMEDIATE sake", "For the above stated sake", "For the initiative sake", etc. The attention head also seems to be insensitive to changes in casing of "For the" and "for the" but does not trigger for all capital "FOR"..

(18, 2327, 196), ' imaginable', 0.7171717171717171
This head is active when  describes an extreme situation, attribute or experience, indicating a superlative adjective followed by the word "imaginable". In other words, it becomes active when the text refers to something being of highest degree or the most possible extreme, usually in a subjective or perceived context. For example phrases like "the happiest day imaginable" or "the best agricultural districts imaginable" trigger the attention head.   The attention head is inactive in the examples where the document still uses the template "the [adjective] [noun] imaginable" but without indicating a sense of extreme or most possible degree, thus it lacks the intensity compared to the active examples. For example phrases like "the cutest thing imaginable" or "the meanest job of imaginable" don't activate the attention head because while they still describe things in terms of 'imaginable', they don't necessarily indicate a superlative degree..

✅  different sizes and styles.  The FF 91 includes the most powerful electric propulsion system and largest and densest battery of imaginable

(18, 515, 83), ' myself', 0.7142857142857143
This head is active when  includes a personal pronoun (usually "I") followed by a modal verb (such as "should", "would", "must", "might", "am") before the "myself" token. This suggests that the attention head is specifically looking for instances where the speaker is discussing a potential action or state they might take or be in.   On the other hand, it seems to be inactive in examples where "myself" is preceded by a phrase or clause, or another verbal construction not including modal verbs. For instance, continuous verb forms ("I'm myself"), past verb forms ("I haven’t really myself"), future verb forms ("I won't and can't myself"), or even phrases involving prepositions ("for the life of me myself") do not activate the attention head..
Examples where the head is active:
✅ I'll probably not myself
✅  check out the different flying machines. I must myself
✅ I must myself
❌  YouTube today. I may have to myself

(19, 589, 302), ' bids', 0.7142857142857143
This head is active when  is discussing or hinting at potential transactions, agreements, transfers, or acquisitions, specifically in the context of sports, where a figure (be it a team, company or individual) is in the process, or the prospect of making a 'bid' or an offer. This includes scenarios of preparing for or being linked with bids, offers and claims. In other words, this attention head seems to be looking for the context of anticipation or preparation to take a competitive action. Conversely, the attention head is inactive in documents that assert completed actions, rejections or the result of a transaction, where a bid has already been made and either accepted or turned down. .
Examples where the head is active:

(20, 2506, 260), ' 2015', 0.7083333333333334
This head is active when  refers to a specific date or event directly before the year "2015". In active examples, the year "2015" follows and is related to directly mentioned events or dates such as "New Year's", "May 19-21," or "Fall/Winter." On the other hand, in inactive examples, "2015" follows a more extended explanation or event and is not directly attached to the named events such as "Artist of the Month for February", "Contest ends 01/10/", or "At its I/O". Thus, the attention head is sensitive to proximity and the directness of the relationship between events/dates and the year "2015"..

(18, 3621, 302), ' backdrop', 0.7083333333333333
This head is active when  mentions an item, object or concept that is blending, contrasting, distinguishing, or interacting in some way with the "backdrop". It seems to be looking out for situations where the "backdrop" is a significant element to which something else is compared or related. In inactive examples, the word "backdrop" is seen as more of a passive background description rather than an active element of comparison or interaction. Also, in many of the inactive cases, it seems like the action is happening against the backdrop, rather than with, in or amidst it, as seen in the active examples..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  berries are so deep and vivid against backdrop
✅  roughly nine hours later, and was shocked by the live images he saw on his tablet screen.  The videos show a shock of black crude against backdrop

(18, 3317, 172), ' basis', 0.7045454545454546
This head is active when  contains the phrase "on the one basis" or "on full basis". This means that this attention head is looking for these specific phrases, and is not active if the phrase slightly deviates from this pattern or uses different words, like in the inactive examples..

(17, 2781, 325), ' song', 0.7032967032967032
This head is active when  refers to a song mostly in a neutral or descriptive manner, as in stating the name of the song, artist, or context in which it was played. The head seems to be particularly sensitive to explicit reference phrases such as "song of", "classic song", or a direct mention of a song like "Chopin song" or "Britney Spears jam from 2003: song".   In contrast, the attention head is inactive when the document mentions a song as part of an action or event, such as "dancing to song", "listened to song", "cover of song", or when the song is part of a larger narrative context, like "taking her daughter to a Jonas Brothers song".   In sum, chances for this attention head to be active seem to increase when the song is being described or identified, rather than being merely a component of a larger context or event..

(17, 1343, 302), ' fabric', 0.7
This head is active when  mentions a certain quality or attribute of the fabric just before stating the word "fabric". In the active examples, the head triggers on descriptors such as "Cordura", "high quality", "increasingly-tough", "anodized", "blend of Lycra", "coated", "durable", "snakeskin", "electrically conductive", "biocompatible", "grippy", "MicroFibre", and "anodised". The attention head does not seem to activate when simply stating that something is made of fabric, as seen in the inactive examples..

(17, 4317, 315), ' slightest', 0.7
This head is active when  does not include the word "even" immediately preceding the next token "slightest". Conversely, the head is inactive when the word "even" is present in the context right before "slightest". This suggests that the focus of this attention head is determining the presence or absence of "even" to predict the token "slightest". Consequently, it's potentially sensitive to the sentence structure and language context around the target word..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  them could even look him in the eye. On this night, it was amazing any slightest

(17, 4317, 210), ' slightest', 0.7
This head is active when  contains the phrase structure "even [verb] slightest." In the active examples, the structure is evident: "why even slightest," "he even slightest," "they even think slightest," etc. This specific attention head seems to be activated by this distinct lexical pattern. Meanwhile, in the inactive examples, although "slightest" and "even" appear, they often do not follow the specific pattern "even [verb] slightest" necessary to trigger the attention head..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  dare I even slightest

(18, 4532, 321), ' promises', 0.696969696969697
This head is active when  indicates actions or efforts taken to fulfill or carry out promises. It is specifically activated by verbs or phrases implying fulfillment such as "follow through", "fulfill", "executing", "make good on", "deliver on", and "meet its". It seems this attention head is trained to recognize phrases that suggest affirmation of upholding a promise.  On the other hand, when the document simply mentions promises without any clear indication of them being fulfilled or attempted to fulfill, this attention head is inactive. This includes examples with phrases such as "failure to implement", "keep his word promises", "live up to promises", "double checking results against promises", and "taken at word promises", among others. This suggests that the presence of the word "promises" alone does not trigger the attention head, rather, the context and associated action towards the promise are crucial in activating it..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  crew indeed fulfilled their promises
✅  deliver on its promises
✅ star lineup of artists will go through with promises
✅  follow through on its promises
✅  deliver on his promises
✅  from big economies are bearing out this promises

(19, 2709, 361), ' threshold', 0.696969696969697
This head is active when  uses the word "threshold" in the context of a goal or limit that is being approached or reached, often accompanied by verbs such as "reach", "attain", "hit", "surpass", or "exceeded". It seems particularly sensitive to scenarios where the threshold refers to a specific and well-defined target, such as a monetary limit, a number of items, or a milestone in time or progress. On the other hand, the head is inactive when "threshold" is applied more loosely, as a general term for a limit or boundary that is crossed, exceeded or met, without a clear or explicit target in sight, or when it is used in a more technical or legal context, such as toxicological threshold or jurisdictional requirements..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  cards or has a higher sum of values.    As soon as a player meets threshold

(19, 1895, 330), ' murdered', 0.6944444444444444
This head is active when  suggests something ambiguous, controversial, or tragic tied to the upcoming word "murdered" often relating to an unexpected, unusual, or shocking event. For instance, instances where the head is active include sentences indicating mourning, protests, shocking deaths, and commemorations.   Conversely, the attention head is inactive in more straightforward contexts where the "murdered" party is easily identifiable, such as in a clear situation of war/conflict (like the British soldiers in Helmand Province or the discus thrower in an automobile accident). So, while the context is still tragic, it is less unexpected or confusing and does not warrant extra attention. This attention head seems particularly triggered by ambiguity or uncertainty around the event or person being "murdered"..

(16, 2470, 261), ' goddamn', 0.6875
This head is active when  features casual or informal language, a conversational tone or direct address to the reader. It appears to focus more on context where there is a build up or anticipation for the term "goddamn", especially when there's use of interjections or expressions such as "such as", "you know", "well", "you guessed it", and "uh". These phrases tend to suggest a conversational style or a direct address to the reader, possibly implying colloquialism or informal language usage.   In contrast, the attention head is inactive in examples where the term "goddamn" is used abruptly or not as part of a larger, casual-toned phrase. For instance, when "goddamn" is used after ellipsis, or directly follows a statement without any conversational indicators, or in more formal or factual descriptions, the attention head stays inactive..

This head is active when  contains a negative or neutral statement or expression ending with "at nor". Most active examples contain noticeable negative or neutral expressions like 'didn't surprise me', 'didn't seem to mind', 'don't recommend', 'don't mind', 'no problem', 'anxiety symptoms aren't dangerous', 'no slack', 'doesn't seem to apply'.   On the other hand, the inactive examples contain more diverse sentence structures, and many of them don't end with the specific structure "at nor". Some of them have positive or neutral statements, others have negative sentences but don't end with "at nor" but use "nor" in a different context. Therefore, this attention head is particularly sensitive to negative or neutral phrases, which end with "at nor"..

This head is active when  includes a reference to specific roles or activities related to the county, or refers to an specific event or action that took place in the county. It seems it gets activated not merely by the presence of the word “County” but when information about the county is critical to the context of the statement.   For example, in most active cases the mention of the county helps in understanding an event taking place such as a court hearing, a voting activity, a clean-up process,'someone's identity, among others. These sentences often mention specific actions, locations, or people within that county.   On the other hand, in the examples where the head is inactive, the mention of “County” tends to be less integral to understanding the context. The County is often mentioned as a part of common noun phrases (e.g., Court of Appeals of County) or is not associated with specific activities or individuals. Action or events are usually less clear, with County being just a locational tag..

It looks for patterns that suggest something is being kept hidden or private, such as "not identify," "not authorized," "won't name," "not disclose," "not releasing details," "sealed," "remained confidential," "could not comment," "all secret," or "work must be done behind."  Often, these phrases are followed by "confidentiality" to specify the reason for the nondisclosure.  On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when phrases such as "asked to remain," "condition of," "wished to remain," "did not want," "not disclose," "withheld for," "did not wish," "will remain anonymous," "refused," "were underway behind," or "was developed behind" are used before "confidentiality." It suggests these specific phrases don't signify the need for predicting "confidentiality" by this attention head.

This head is active when  contains the word "votes" preceded by a noun or proper noun specifically referring to an individual or group of people, or a political assertion related to voting outcomes. This can be a political figure, political group, or political process.   Examples include "Bundestag votes," which refers to the federal parliament in Germany, "Yarmuth votes," possibly referring to John Yarmuth, a U.S. Congressman, and "Gabbard votes," likely indicating Tulsi Gabbard, another U.S. politician.  On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the word "votes" is preceded by other parts of speech, particles, or when there's a break in the coherence of the text regarding voting or political figures. For instance, “Saskia Clark – GB Olympic Gold Medal Winning Sailor Stella Creasy votes” is an inactive example where the context of "votes" is disconnected (an Olympic sailor doesn't logically connect to voting).

This head is active when  seems to be discussing a group or collection of people, often in the process of doing or experiencing something together. This ranges from communities ("we found our forefathers following such a community"), to named groups (i.e. "Asiong’s gang", "tribesmen from the region of Shimashki,", etc.) to collective nouns (i.e "the Japan Air Self-Defense Force", "presidium", etc.). The attention head seems to be triggered when some communal or collective action is about to be described, hence the prediction of "collectively" as the next token.  On the other hand, this attention head in inactive when the document is discussing individual actions or ideas, or when "collectively" does not make semantic sense in its context. For example, in the inactive examples, the documents talk about individual actions like "Today he tweeted" or individual ideas like "America’s favorite Kevin". These examples, though they might reference other people, are not discussing communal.

It's especially active when phrases such as "I was having", "I have the same", or "this is a common" are followed by or associated with "syndrome". The head may be detecting a pattern where a problem or condition is being related to or compared with "syndrome", as a way to predict that the next token will be "syndrome".   It's inactive when "syndrome" is mentioned in a direct, medically-oriented manner like stating specific medical conditions like "polycystic syndrome" or "carpal tunnel syndrome".

It seems to specifically activate when these modal verbs are used in the context of questioning or rhetorical questioning. The attention head remains inactive when these verbs are not used, regardless of the presence of negation statements. For instance, the inactive example "I do like a lot anymore" does present some negation, but since it doesn't include any of the specified modal verbs, the attention head won't activate..

It's mostly looking for a specific pattern where "sake" is expected to be used in a phrase that highlights the reason or cause for something.   In the inactive examples, the patterns are altered. The attention head does not act when 'sake' follows possessives like "everyone's", "God's", words in capital letters like "IMMEDIATE", or command syntax "/F". It also seems to be not acting when there are code strings or when the phrase is fragmented or has additional words or characters.

The attention head seems to be looking for verbs that indicate the achieving or crossing of a threshold. In the inactive examples, while the concept of a threshold is present, the verbs used do not suggest the action of reaching or crossing over a threshold, making the attention head inactive.

This head is active when  describes an event or physical condition that directly interacts with or affects the "clouds". It seems to pay attention to documents that denote changes in the clouds due to natural factors such as the sun, waves, tornado, moon, hurricane, rain or lava. The wording of the sentence usually describes a dynamic process or condition that is leading to or involving the changing of "clouds".   On the other hand, it remains inactive when the document simply refers to the clouds in a static context or the interaction is caused by human-made factors like seeing somebody or something moving past clouds or if the clouds are merely a backdrop to another event or situation, e.g. monitoring the moon above clouds, black smoke pouring into clouds, or the wind was blowing (but not affecting cloud formation)..

This head is active when  contains phrases that describe the action or process leading to the negotiation, rather than the result or outcome of the negotiation. For instance, phrases like "U.S. and Russian-brokered negotiation" or "have been holding peace talks since 2012, and in May last year reached negotiation" highlight the entities involved and the process to reach a negotiation. In contrast, phrases like "reach a compromise negotiation" or "for a compromise negotiation" are more focused on the outcome or purpose of the negotiation, thus leading to the attention head's inactivity. Similarly, phrases beginning with prepositions such as 'for', 'to' usually make the head inactive as they are more focused on the aim or purpose of the negotiation. This attention head seems to be particularly sensitive to the positioning and context of the word "negotiation"..

(20, 338, 292), ' actual', 0.6666666666666666
This head is active when  features an incomplete or vague sentence that requires the word "actual" to confirm or solidify its meaning. More often than not, the head is active when the sentence prior to "actual" hints at some form of realization, confirmation or even emphasis. For instance, sentences like "I finally felt like actual" and "I was mesmerised and more turned on than I’d ever been before. For once, I actual". Here, the placement of "actual" is expected to relay a conclusion or assert some kind of realization.  In contrast, the head is inactive when the document features a more complete sentence prior to "actual" and the word "actual" is used in combination with another "actual," as a direct adjective or to signify accomplishment, rather than a revelation or conclusion. For example, "seems to be an actual actual" or "on Trump from the moment he became a serious actual", here "actual" is used just for putting emphasis or quantifying something priorly known or.

(20, 338, 240), ' actual', 0.6666666666666666
This head is active when  includes the token "actual" in a repetitive or redundant manner, often appearing as a pair ("actual actual") or followed by another "actual"-related word (like "actually actual"). This could suggest that the attention head may be recognizing or emphasizing a certain semantic or syntactic pattern related to the word "actual". However, the attention head is not active when "actual" or "actually" is used in a more normal or conventional way within the sentences, or when "actual" is the last word in the statement. It also seems inactive when "actual" or "actually" is used in more complex narrative descriptions..

This head is active when  contains an implied comparison or relates to a prior statement or concept, often discussing an example or scenario, followed by a suggestion, assumption or conclusion that something else should or might occur or operate in a similar manner. The active documents often include cues such as "like", "as much", "same", "just like", etc. before "similarly."  However, the attention head is inactive when "similarly" is used in a context where the comparative process, event, condition, or attribute is explicitly stated prior to "similarly," often following a more directive or declarative statement. The inactive documents typically include direct instructions or stronger assertions before "similarly" or the sentence structure explicitly states the comparison..

This head is active when  relates to an individual or a group reflecting upon their own actions or conditions. It is likely to be active when the sentence discusses personal experiences, viewpoints, or changes. The attention head detects when the context of the text is introspective or self-related. This can include individual self-reflection, an organization reflecting on its actions, or a third party describing another's self-reflection.  For instance, in the active examples, there are phrases like "show others what responsible use looks like while we themselves", "to change what your dog is doing, you have to change what you are doing themselves", and "Lowrie themselves" which feature the theme of self-reflection or change.   On the contrary, it is inactive when the context is more about external conditions or others' actions or experiences rather than the self. In these examples, the expectation of "themselves" being the next token is not relevant because the preceding context is not about self-reflection or change.   For instance,.

This head is active when  mentions a specific type of legal role or status, such as "Appellant" or "Appellants", prior to the token "appellate". It seems to focus on legal language, particularly the mention of parties involved in a legal dispute or appeal (hence the use of "Appellant" or "Appellants").

Specifically, it seems to be focusing on a negation or minimization of an action or concept, showing up in contexts where the text discusses not doing something or rejecting or minimizing certain behavior or states. However, this attention head does not activate when the phrase "slightest" is used in a different context, like "without the slightest" or "even a slightest" or when it's used after a long sentence.

On the other hand, the attention head is not active when the document simply mentions people wearing sunglasses, with no specific association with a dressing up event or a particular feature of clothing.

This head is active when  seems to be referencing a collective group or action, especially when there is an event or situation that includes multiple participants involved.

In most of the active examples, the tone or context indicates a concern, issue, problem or potential negative impact, and then introduces the token "Worse" to express the aggravation or decline of the situation. This particular head pays attention to sentences that forecast or imply something is going to deteriorate or negatively change.  In the inactive examples, the context does not always necessarily predict a fall or deterioration. The statements are more neutral or varied in sentiment, ranging from neutral descriptions to positive affirmations, thereby not necessitating the prediction of the word "Worse".

The attention head is also active when "of course" is used at the end of a list or series of items, like "whales, and, of course" or "a Batarang, and of course".

This head is active when  contains religious, biblical, or theological contexts prior to the word "Apostles". It seems to be sensitive to verses or references to religious books (like Luke 9, John 6, Matthew 16), religious terms (like Resurrection, prophets, Israelites), and religious expressions or entities (like "Allah Ta‘ala", "sayeth the Lord", "Christ lives in me").   However, the attention head does not become active for all instances of religious context, suggesting it might be specifically tuned to certain forms or aspects of religious text. For instance, in the second inactive example, although it discusses religious themes, the text primarily focuses on physical laws and nature, which might explain why the attention head remains inactive.  Moreover, in the other inactive examples such as "the Lord Apostles" and "41 So Apostles", the prior context may be too brief or lacking the necessary religious cues that the attention head is trained to respond to, thus leading to its inactivity..

This head is active when  mentions the subject's death in a roundabout way, or the sentence structure is incomplete or non-standard. In the active examples, the expected phrasing would be "he died" or "he passed away", but instead, text ends with "he was death" or "he passed death". In inactive examples, the death of the subject is mentioned, but the sentence structure is more standard, such as "he died" or "he passed away". Therefore, this attention head seems to be specifically identifying instances where there are potential errors or non-standard uses of the word "death"..

This head is active when  includes specific language indicating the completion, achievement, or execution of "promises" - typically containing 'past' or 'present continuous' tense verbs. In all of the active examples, verbs like "off","meets", "live up to", "fulfils", "failed to meet", "proving", "executed", and "fulfill my word" precede the token "promises". These phrases imply that a promise has been or is being fulfilled.  In the inactive examples, however, phrases are constructed with future tense, implying plans or obligations to fulfill promises in the future such as "to follow through on", "will fulfill", "make good on", "deliver on", or "arrived... as". These phrases suggest either future or hypothetical fulfillment of promises, which does not trigger this particular attention head. The attention head seems to be sensitive to the tense of the sentence and whether a promise is depicted as being already fulfilled or in the process of fulfillment, rather than.

This head is active when  does not contain special characters or marks right before the word "Scripture". Also, it tends to activate when the word or abbreviation before "Scripture" does not contain numbers or is not a well-known acronym or name. In the inactive examples, we see entries like "O2 Scripture", "TRON Cell Scripture", or "Maci Bookout Scripture" where the preciding words are well-known or contain numbers, which appears to be a pattern where this attention head remains inactive. Similarly, if the text before "Scripture" includes special characters like "[[@B1" or "*,", the attention head is inactive.

This head is active when  includes some details about the individual who was murdered, their background, or the circumstances surrounding their murder. Typically these details provide some additional texture to the individual's life or the events leading up to their murder. This could include their occupation, their actions leading up to their death, the location, a brief personal history, or the impact of their death on others.  On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the document discusses the murder in a more detached or impersonal way, often just mentioning that someone was murdered without providing much additional information about the individual or the murder itself..

This head is active when  mentions a collective concept, group, or an inanimate object before "themselves". It seems this attention head operates based on the concept of reflexivity – when the action of the subject is reflected back on the subject. It especially picks up on collections or groups (like "Sierra Leoneans", "Rezzian gods") and inanimate objects or concepts (like "television partners", "easing function", "information").   However, attention head is not active when the sentence refers to a single individual or specific person just before "themselves". For example, in inactive instances, there are immediate mentions of specific individuals like "the man", "Lowrie", "Mourinho", or "her" just before "themselves". In other words, it may be focusing on non-individual and larger collective entities for reflexivity, rather than specific individuals..

This head is active when  has a sentence structure in which the verb preceding "regularly" is directly associated with the subject of the sentence, without any conjunctions, relative pronouns, or commas introducing additional information about the subject.   In the active examples, the sentence structure is simple: "subject + verb + regularly". For instance, "I go regularly", "He goes regularly", "I make regularly", and so on. However, in the inactive examples, the sentences have added layers of complexity with conjunctions, relative clauses, or additional information between the verb and "regularly". For examples, "said a member of the Distrikt camp who goes regularly", "four women, who still get regularly", "I don’t go regularly", which either disrupts the direct sequence between verb and "regularly" or negates the action..

It also seems to activate more frequently when the "quicker" characterisation is alongside another characteristic description such as "bigger", "denser", "harder", "deeper", etc.   In the inactive examples, most of them still involve comparison, but they often use explicit comparative phrases such as "just as", "but", "same as", "more", etc. and the subject being compared to is often present in the same sentence..

This head is active when  contains phrases where the word "anymore" is used to indicate the discontinuation or cessation of a state or action. This usually occurs after a negative construction ("did not", "do not", "not at", "no") followed by a verb or adjective that specifies the state or action that has stopped.   In the inactive examples, the usage of "anymore" typically comes after statements of negation where it is used to confirm the continuation of the non-existence of something. However, these phrases don't offer the specific action or state that is no longer happening, they simply present negations ("No criminal", "No glowy particle effects", "were not threatening", etc.), thus not activating this attention head.   For instance, in the phrase "is not graphic anymore," the attention head is activated because a specific state (graphic) has ceased to exist, while in the phrase “no criminal anymore”, the attention head is not activated because there is no mention of an.

This head is active when  does not contain the word "at" immediately before the token "nor". If the word "at" precedes "nor", then the attention head is inactive. In all other cases, such as when other words or punctuations come before "nor", the attention head is activated. This suggests that the neural network is recognizing a specific syntactical pattern in which "at nor" is either not correct or less frequently used in language. Therefore, it anticipates the word "nor" but not in an "at nor" context. This may also mean that the head is trained to predict " nor" after specific negative phrases or contractions like "don't", "doesn't", "—without", etc, but the phrase "at nor" appears to be an exception to this pattern..

This head is active when  is indicating a relationship of comparison or similar actions/consequences between two or more entities, or is suggesting a similar behavior to be followed or expected based on the previous context/statement. It appears to become active when the context highlights similarity, parallel actions or encourages repetition of an action.   This can be seen in active examples such as "Qatar's Chamber of Commerce...urging Muslim states to do similarly" implying that other states should follow the same action, or "...repairs it, soon all the others will be broken as similarly", suggesting a similar consequence.  In inactive examples, even though the word "similarly" is used, it's not necessarily implying a direct comparison or parallel action but rather using "similarly" to depict common sequences or events. For example, "with Nicholas Schilkey (Green Bay) following similarly" is merely describing an event following another, rather than implying any comparison or similar behavior to be followed.

This head is active when  suggests an action of testing or trying something without using the explicit phrases such as "try", "run" or "trial" directly before "test". Instead, words like "take", "let", "use", "exchange", "build", "give", "get", "make", "become" etc. are used as indicators to the action of doing a test. The head is inactive when words like "run", "try", "trial" are directly used before "test", or if "test" is used as a noun (like in testing, tests) rather than as part of an action to be implemented..

This head is active when  is discussing mutual actions, decisions or conditions between two parties, generally in a formal or specific context. These documents often mention official actions, agreements, interactions, or phenomena where two entities are involved in a reciprocal or mutual manner. These can involve political decisions, scientific phenomena, sports events, legal issues, or relationships between characters. In contrast, the head is not active when 'mutually' is used in a more informal or casual context, such as personal relationships or when it's not followed by a verbose description of a formal event or context..

For example, "has been a repository for unwanted radioactive sources for lately" or "Heart rate has been an important factor in indicating patients' health for lately".   However, this attention head is not active when the term "lately" is used with other prepositions such as "on", "in" or "with". For example: "been working on the plug-in for lately" or "I’ve been writing songs on my own in my basement in Paris for the lately".   In other words, the attention head seems to be looking specifically for the pattern “has been... for lately” or other very similar patterns, and it will not respond if the word "for" is missing or not in the correct context, or if the pattern is not followed..

The structure of the active sentences usually contains constructs like "has been", "have been" or "’ve been" following by a verb indicating ongoing actions such as "working", "trying", "making", and so on. In the inactive examples, although some sentences also include the construct "has been" or "have", they either do not describe a continuous past action or the phrase is being used in a different context..

This head is active when  contains the phrase "on" followed by a word and then "basis", without any punctuation, capitalization, or special characters intervening. Essentially, it is looking for a continuous, lowercase sequence of the form "on _ basis". Therefore it would not be active when the sequence is separated by capital letters, punctuation, special characters or contains extra words..

This head is active when  is constructing a sentence or statement that establishes a requirement, an obligation, or a necessary action that needs to be taken. The scenarios where it is activated typically contain an imperative tone, referring to what "must" or "need" to be done or completed. Phrases such as "must be", "need to", or "all the steps" often precede "anymore" which in these cases seems to imply a sense of completion or the end of an operation.   In contrast, the attention head is inactive when the context is not about the obligatory nature of the situation or when the next token "anymore" does not make logical sense or is not necessarily convey the end of a process or operation. The inactive examples tend to revolve around descriptive scenarios, statistical implications, or non-essential, non-obligatory statements, and hence, the specific attention head remains inactive..

This head is active when  mentions a person or a position immediately before the token " votes". Often, these figures of interest are related to political roles or activities. They can be politicians, representatives, or roles within a governmental structure. When there is additional context or description present before "votes", the head does not activate. Therefore, it is particularly sensitive to a single-name mention preceding " votes"..

This head is active when  suggests renovations in context of a place being transformed or repurposed from its original or previous state. It seems to be triggered specifically by indications that a renovation will follow, such as "located inside an unassuming, converted", "acquired a 130,000 square-foot", "been boarded up", "demolished in 2008 to make way for", the mentioning of previous establishments such as "the site of the former", or seemingly unrelated actions to renovations like "summer into a second floor space" or to "give your entertainment unit a fresh update". In contrast, it is inactive when some transformations or implementations are explicitly mentioned, like "was converted", "having plans to convert it", "previously used", "formerly occupied" or it's mentioned the establishment is already "a two-story renovated". The attention head seems to be focusing on contexts that indicate a forthcoming renovation rather than a completed one..

(17, 1460, 334), ' ago', 0.6041666666666667
This head is active when  does not use the preposition "or" before the term "ago". The head looks for instances where the token "ago" appears without an "or" directly preceding it. In inactive examples, the attention head is not triggered because the phrase "or ago" is used. This is a strange pattern as it does not mesh well with natural language understanding because the token "ago" is usually used in relation to time and should work correctly in both the active and inactive examples provided. Nonetheless, this is what this specific attention head has learned to focus on from the dataset it was trained on..

(20, 3754, 302), ' languages', 0.6041666666666667
This head is active when  discusses multiple languages or the ability to speak in multiple languages. It seems quite sensitive to the context and topic of language fluity, proficiency, or multiculturalism. However, it doesn't pay attention to instances where specific languages are mentioned or the focus is on a single language's fluency. For example, in the inactive examples, discussions about the proficiency or fluency in Mandarin, Cantonese or an endangered language do not trigger this attention head. Furthermore, general phrases regarding language learning ("speaking languages," "training language will be languages") do not seem to activate this head. Conversely, it is activated in contexts where there is a general reference to language capability without mentioning any specific language, or when multiple languages are discussed obliquely..

This head is active when  is using a term or word and subsequently explaining or alluding to its use as an adjective. This implies that there is a direct connection or explanation of a term, words, or phrase with quotation marks, brackets or single words followed directly by the term "adjective".   In inactive examples, the token "adjective" seems to be used more randomly and doesn't follow a clear pattern, meaning, it doesn't necessarily explain or allude to the preceding term or phrase being an adjective. For example, in some cases, it ends the sentence without a preceding word or term that it would directly refer to. In others, it appears after additional words that interrupt its direct connection to the term it may be referring to..

(16, 2470, 249), ' goddamn', 0.6000000000000001
This head is active when  frames "goddamn" as an informal or colloquial interjection or an expletive added for emphasis, often appearing after interjections like "well," "you know," "except," and "uh". The attention head tends to be active when the token "goddamn" follows a pause, represented by a comma, enhancing the surprise or exasperation tone in the document.   In the inactive examples, "goddamn" doesn't add emphasis to informal interjections or expressions of surprise or exasperation as in the active cases. It can appear abruptly at the end of the sentence, or the preceding context does not have an informal or colloquial tone. Thus, it seems the key is a combination of informality and the use of "goddamn" for emphasis following a pause..

This head is active when  indicates anticipation or preparation ahead of starting a particular regimen. It captures the context where someone is about to start, is suggested to start, or has just initiated a new regimen. It is also often associated with clear determination of timing or dose, for instance, "twice daily regimen," or "orally three times a day regimen".   In the inactive examples, the regimen context is typically present, but there is not a strong indication of the regimen being started or about to be started. The relation between the subjects and the regimen suggests that the regimen is already ongoing. Also, frequently, the explicit timing or dosing information is absent in the inactive examples..

These phrases tend to imply more context or explanation will follow, presumably about the specific regimen.   On the other hand, in inactive examples, the word "regimen" typically follows directly after a specific medical term or name of a medication ("blocker, tropisetron regimen", "50 mg every day regimen", "levetir regimen") without the similar anticipatory or explanatory context found in the active examples. The attention head seems to be inactive when the regimen is already mentioned or detailed without the need for further explanation. This could be indicative of the attention head's role in recognizing the need for providing or expecting additional details about a regimen..

✅ recommending that I start subcutaneous regimen
✅  absorption, she was started on regimen
❌ The patient was started on regimen

This head is active when  mentions a specific freeway by a certain identifier like 'I-25' or 'Interstate 25' without preceding it with specific verbs or prepositions such as 'along', 'over', 'by', or 'on'. In the active examples, freeways are usually mentioned bluntly often with its specific identifier, while in the inactive examples, the freeway is often part of a longer description or is accessed or traveled over. It seems that the attention head is less about the presence of a freeway and more about how the freeway is mentioned in the context of the sentence..

(17, 1460, 106), ' ago', 0.6
This head is active when  mentions a measure of age or time followed by the word "ago." This can be seen from the active examples containing phrases like "65 years of age or ago," "75 years and ago," "60 years and ago," etc. The inactive examples do not fit this pattern as they convey different types of measurements or unrelated contexts, such as "increase in size following the construction," "four or five cars ago," and "10,000 or ago," among others. It appears that the attention head is extracting patterns of age or time, thus helping the model to predict that the " ago" token would follow those expressions..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  who was 65 years of age or ago
✅  $75. If at least one member of your household is age 65 or ago

(18, 515, 44), ' myself', 0.6
This head is active when  contains fragmented or incomplete sentences that seem to be missing the next action or verb after "myself". The head seems to be trying to predict situations where there is a need for a verb or an action word following "myself".   In the active examples like "*Sorry, not to distract from the OP and the primary discussion, I just felt myself", "*Then based on these we (re)act. I am aware myself", and "*for the life of me myself", the next word is missing and the phrases do not make sense as they are, thus the head is needed to predict the next token being "myself".   Whereas in the inactive examples like "*I should write myself", "* thought I would myself", "* I have to confess myself", the sentences are missing the ending but seem to already have a verb indicating an action related to "myself". This head does not activate because it does not need to predict "myself" as the sentences already have a verb or.

This head is active when  refers to an activity or action (such as climbing, trekking, hiking, experiencing, spotting, sweating, braving, being lost, etc.) happening on a mountain or about a mountain. It appears to be focusing on sentences where a person or people are physically interacting with the mountain in some way.   On the other hand, when the attention head is inactive, it seems like it is either when the sentence refers to a specific mountain by name (like 'Pikes Peak mountain') or when the sentence refers to a mountain in context but without a direct physical action or interaction happening on or towards the mountain (like 'were sick from exposure to the elements mountain').  The neutral or passive descriptions about mountains also do not activate the attention head..

(16, 3144, 302), ' shoes', 0.5989010989010989
This head is active when  contains unexpected and irregular usage of the term "shoes". In the active examples, "shoes" is often used in unusual, syntactically incorrect, or unexpected ways. For instance, "S UNDERWEAR shoes" or "wearing nothing shoes" do not follow usual grammatical rules or common phrases associated with "shoes".  On the other hand, the head is inactive in documents where "shoes" is used in a conventional, expected manner. For instance, "mens shoes", "Converse shoes", or "worn a pair shoes" are common uses of the word in everyday language, as they correctly refer to the item of clothing..

(20, 4368, 399), ' together', 0.5980392156862745
This head is active when  discusses multiple elements, substances, components, or entities that are implied to collectively contribute to a particular function or action. The items being brought together are often technical or abstract, such as data sources, system configurations, or research methodologies. Usually, they're mentioned in a context where their cooperative functioning or interaction is significant.  It becomes inactive when the context lacks this specific type of cooperation/interaction or when the entities being "brought together" are not of a similar nature contributing to a co-function. For example, pressing two keys together does not suggest the same cooperative interaction as combining data sources. While both actions involve combining entities, only one of them implies that the entities being combined will cooperate or interact in a way that's significant to the sentence's overall meaning..

(17, 3643, 309), ' similarly', 0.59375
This head is active when  is trying to predict the word "similarly" that is used in a context to compare or indicate that a thing or action is being performed or should be performed in the same way as something else stated in the previous part of the sentence.   In every active example, there is a clear reference point or analogy being drawn, whether it's comparing East and West Germany to another situation, suggesting that something that worked in one case (like a recruitment tool or saving money) will work in another, or stating that something we have for one thing (a car) we should have for another (our home).   In the inactive examples, while "similarly" might seem like a logical next word, the phrasing or context does not exactly match the pattern that this attention head has learned. These examples might still involve a comparison or recommendation, but they aren't presented in a way that directly triggers this attention head. For example, sentences that begin with 'Just as' or 'Just like' might.

(19, 1310, 374), ' Turns', 0.59375
This head is active when  contains an expectation, assumption or belief that is in some way contradicted or does not pan out as initially thought or planned. In other words, a change or flip in the expected outcome seems to trigger the attention head. It often tends to be active when the document contains phrases such as "expected," "thought," "assumed," "believed," etc., followed by a realization that these expectations were incorrect. The attention head thus seems to be picking up on these changes in expectation.   Conversely, the attention head stays inactive in documents where there is no clear expectation set up or the initial belief or expectation continues without being contradicted or proven wrong. It may also remain inactive when the turnaround or shift in expectations is not explicitly stated..

This head is active when  mentions a name or brand, followed by the word "Company." However, the trigger seems to be not only the mention of a company, but also the surrounding context. This attention head seems particularly interested in companies when they are mentioned in relation to a product, service, person (e.g. CEO), or action associated with the company (e.g. method developed by, sold by, manufactured by, etc). The surrounding context seems to be important in differentiating the usage and relevance of a many different companies.  In the inactive examples where "Company" is also mentioned, the context is different. Rather than highlighting some important aspect related to the company (i.e., services, product, executives or a unique action), it merely states a flat relationship (such as division of, profile of, acquisition by, etc.), or just mentions it without a strong associative context. It seems this attention head "ignores" these scenarios as less informative for predicting the next token as "Company.".

This head is active when  refers to a completion or achievement of something in a fast, almost immediate manner. This is marked by phrases like "within blink", "in blink", "[done/achieved] in blink", indicating a quick or speedy process. The attention head likely focuses on these patterns to predict the next token "blink". However, it is not active when there are additional qualifying or descriptive words, such as "short amount blink", "less blink", "three blink", "under blink", and similarly non-absolute or comparative phrases. The attention head is also not active in sentences with a more complex structure or additional context such as "—and have half of the Garbage Patch cleaned up in just blink" or "We deployed a commercial product in under blink". It seems that this attention head is specifically looking for simple structures indicating immediate or very quick completion..

This head is active when  contains the phrase "all ... whatsoever" or similar variations (like "any ... whatsoever"), where the word "whatsoever" follows a noun or a noun phrase to signify 'of any kind at all'. It could also be active when "whatsoever" follows a clause or sentence implying a very general statement. However, for it to be active, "whatsoever" can't be separated from its preceding word or phrase by a comma, or followed by a continuation of the sentence, which is often the case in the inactive examples. So, it seems the head turns inactive when too many words, especially commas and other punctuation, come between "all/any" and "whatsoever", disrupting this specific construction..

(18, 1375, 301), ' untrue', 0.5833333333333334
This head is active when  contains a statement or assumption that is being contradicted or refuted. Often, the sentences preceding the word "untrue" make a false claim or present a misconception that is then dismissed as "untrue." The attention head seems to focus on situations where there is a contrast or opposition to a previously stated idea, often expressed in a belief or claim that is then contested. The nature of the contradictory statement prior to "untrue" can vary widely, spanning different topics and structures.  In contrast, where the attention head is inactive, we find a similar pattern of challenging a statement or assumption, yet the syntactical structure of the sentence seems different - more compressed and direct, or using different constructions ("compared to", "larger than") than those found in the active examples. There may be other nuanced linguistic differences that this attention head is sensitive to causing it to be inactive..

It appears to be more active in sentences where "myself" is used as a reflexive pronoun or in expressions where "myself" often appears.   On the other hand, it is inactive when the positioning of "myself" is less predictable or unconventional. The sentences where the attention head is inactive often feature additional words or clauses in between the preceding token and "myself", or use "myself" in less common grammatical structures. This makes it harder for the attention head to anticipate "myself" as the next token..

This head is active when  suggests a complete end or negation of something, either by using negative contractions (e.g., "aren't", "don't", "can't", "isn't") or explicitly mentioning "no" before the "anymore". This attention head seems to be alert to instances where the language emphasizes the end of a certain condition or state so it predicts the next token will be "anymore".   On the contrary, the head is inactive when the sentence is merely pointing to a transition rather than a full stop. In these instances, "anymore" is often used less definitively to indicate a decrease or reduction, rather than a complete ceasing or absence of something. That is, the actions or states could still persist but not as before. In such situations, the attention head does not activate..

This head is active when  contains a broad or undefined concept that is followed by the term "include". It seems to be particularly sensitive to phrases where the concept is introduced in a vague or meta-disciplinary context - such as "essential functions", "good neighboring elements", "traditional conservatives", or "that liberty".  The attention head does not activate if the term "include" directly follows a concrete term or item which is already clearly defined, like in phrases "that someone include", "this body of work include", "those 50 reels include". Similarly, the attention head does not trigger when the text contains specific data or numerical values next to the term "include" like in "4 units of credit.

The examples show that in these instances, the attention head becomes active in predicting the next token as " Hollande". This could include circumstances where a preceding word indicates status or position such as "Philippe Hollande" suggesting a full name or a trend of shorthand notation referring to Hollande.  In documents where the head is inactive, we typically see longer phrases before " Hollande", often involving complex sentences, locations, or numerical values.

This encompasses situations where the pseudonym is being used to protect the individual's identity, such as the "student in CS 61B," "a man," or "witness," where each individual is purposely keeping their real name hidden. It also includes situations where the pseudonym is used as a more recognizable or preferred title, such as the "Golden State Killer," "a young designer," or "a YouTube user."  Conversely, the head is inactive when the noun preceding "pseudonym" isn't indicating a conscious choice to go by a pseudonym or to remain anonymous.

(20, 4368, 347), ' together', 0.5714285714285714
This head is active when  appears to be discussing a concept or scenario where various elements or entities are being brought together or combined, often in the context of creating a unified result or experience. It seems particularly active when the concept of 'together' is essential in the context of the sentence which means the act of coming together is integral to the situation, action or idea being described.  Its activity seems to have a strong connection with 'functional association'. For instance, it is active in sentences discussing the merging of data sources, combining power sources, listeners being scheduled together, connecting yo-yos together etc., where the idea of 'together' significantly impacts the functionality or outcome.  On the other hand, in the inactive examples, it seems like the attention head is not active when the sentence is passively describing things being 'together' without directly implying a functional change or improvement due to this association. For example, sentences discussing items simply being placed or connected together without highlighting a resulting advantage, or a transformation in the functionality.

(16, 2982, 227), ' desktop', 0.5666666666666667
This head is active when  mentions a specific technology, software, or hardware that can be associated with a desktop environment. This includes names of Development environments (such as Visual Studio and Arduino Uno), Operating Systems (like Ubuntu 10.4), programming languages (Java), and hardware (MacBook Pro). The appearance of these specific terms seems to trigger the attention head to predict the token " desktop".   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the document contains generic or more ambiguous terms related to a desktop environment. This includes more generic terms like "Ubuntu" or "debian" without specific versions, lesser-known software packages (like Jetty, NEON, or SPSS), vague hardware references (like "PC" or "Galaxy SII"), or terms which don't directly relate to a desktop environment (like "__IPHONE" or "_teensy"). These examples either lack the specificity or the direct connection with a desktop environment found in the active examples, thus the attention head doesn't make the association.

This head is active when  refers to completing or achieving a task, event, or action in a very short, unspecified amount of time, symbolized with the phrase "in blink". It appears that the attention head is particularly sensitive to the contexts where there is a significant achievement, growth, change, or development that occurs. This may include successful projects, quick turnovers, impressive performance and more.  However, the attention head is inactive when the document refers to a regular or less significant happening, activity, or action finished quickly. This could be something ordinary and everyday like reading a book, or when the expression of the timeframe is not the central point of discussion, more casual or less emphasized. Simply put, the head seems to require a more significant context than a simple quick happening like an 'easy read' or 'tickets sold out'. This might also be why it's inactive with 'the food ran out within blink'..

This head is active when  discusses the origin or naming of a place, species, or term that is directly associated with "farmland". The active examples often denote a naming etymology or geographical/taxonomic origin relating to "farmland". For instance, instances where a township's name, a species name or an established place name is derived from or refers to 'farmland'. On the contrary, the head is inactive when "farmland" is used in a context that does not involve naming or origination. For instance, when discussing what grows in a farmland, the conditions of a farmland, or when "farmland" is used in a descriptive way, like describing an area or a kind of plant/fruit/herb, the head remains inactive..

This head is active when  contains a negative sentiment or an expression of disapproval or disagreement just before the token "nor". It appears to be focusing on sentences with strong negation, such as "didn't improve", "not intended to", "not use, modify or distribute", "�t be enough", "didn't Complain" etc. This attention head seems to be paying attention to the negative context around the token "nor". In contrast, for the inactive examples, the language is more neutral or positive, or the negativity is less emphatic or absolute, such as "don't mind", "didn't seem to mind", "not hindered", "no problem", "doesn't seem to apply" etc. The context around "nor" in these cases does not seem to trigger this attention head..

(20, 1119, 323), ' themselves', 0.5666666666666667
This head is active when  contains a situation or context where an entity (human or non-human) is referred to in the third person and is doing an action by itself or without outside help. It particularly gets activated when the action and the entity are both present in the same sentence and the word 'themselves' can be used to reinforce this concept.   In contrast, it is inactive when the context of the sentence does not align with the description above: when there is no action that the entity is solely doing or when the text simply doesn't support the use of 'themselves' for any reason according to normal English grammar practices. For example, in "our television partners, as well as for us themselves", the word 'themselves' does not fit in the sentence contextually or grammatically..

This head is active when  contains a description of an individual's clothing or fashion, particularly when the clothing is preceded by a color or pattern indication and followed by "sunglasses." It seems that the attention head specifically activates when the structure is "[color/pattern] [clothing/item] sunglasses." When the mention of sunglasses is not following this pattern (e.g., it lacks a color or pattern, or if sunglasses follow a different sequence of words), the attention head is inactive..

This head is active when  suggests the action of performing, listening, or generally relating to a song directly. In these active cases, the language used is suggesting that the following 'song' element is an integral part of the description. It can be seen as an action being done to the 'song', like: covering, listening, taking to, dancing to, or reading the lyrics of the song. They also imply an interaction or a strong relation between the characters or the context with the song.  Among the inactive examples, the song is not directly being interacted with. Sometimes there is an action done, but it is not directly related to the song itself. For example, 'taking him to see Switchfoot song', 'moving to the song', theme music to song', 'blaring Joplin song', 'humming to song', 'narrated song' and 'listening to song' are cases where the attention head is not active, as the action to the song is indirect or less integral to the.

This head is active when  contains a list or comparison of two or more things that are distinguished in a particular manner, often with distinct attributes or separate pieces of information that directly relate to each item respectively. It is triggered by these elements and their position in relation to the token "respectively". This typically happens in documents presenting scientific data, comparisons, or complex descriptions where respective attributes or information are given to different entities.  On the other hand, the attention head is inactive in documents where "respectively" is present but not used in a way that requires linking specific data or attributes to each entity in a list or comparison. Also, it appears to be inactive in cases where the order of information is inconsistent or the items being compared don't fit into a clear pattern. This often happens in casual context or when less formal language is used..

This head is active when  is talking about combining or connecting two or more distinct pieces, entities or concepts together, especially in the context of systems, objects, or components. For example, different materials, data from various sources, or multiple Mac systems. Additionally, it appears to be active when there is a specific focus on the process or mechanism that allows these entities to be combined.   When the context merely mentions the idea of different things being together without emphasizing the act of combining or connecting them, or the idea is metaphorical or doesn't involve tangible components or systems, the attention head is inactive.

This abstract concept or subjective attribute can be a possessive noun ("everyone's"), an adjective ("same", "right"), an undefined noun ("God's", "initiative") or a plain noun ("layer"). However, the attention head remains inactive when the word "the" is directly followed by specific object or a concrete concept such as "this", "that", "these", or "above stated"..

We can see this in sentences where "whatsoever" is used to emphasize a negative concept like 'nothing', 'absence', 'not', 'don’t', 'without', etc.   On the other hand, the inactive examples tend to use "whatsoever" in more neutral or positive contexts, regardless of whether there is negativity or not. For instance, 'All Joy whatsoever', 'boosts your total conversion charge', etc. Hence, this particular attention head seems to be activated by the combination of negation and the word "whatsoever"..

This head is active when  refers to a specific entity (such as a person or place) or collective action that is about to elaborate or explain something of interest. Many a time, the documents explicitly mention a named entity, often marked by parentheses or quotes, followed by 'collectively'. The head also activates when the document talks about a group action or decision that seems to be made or is about to be discussed, with the element of collective participation emphasized.   In the inactive examples, the term "collectively" is either used in a different context where it does not refer to a collective action or individual, is part of a direct quote, or is absent from the sentence entirely..

This head is active when  refers to someone's passing or death but is phrased in a somewhat indirect or euphemistic manner, often using terms such as "passed" or phrases like "was felt for more than four decades" (implying a long impact or influence that has now ended). The attention head seems to be particularly sensitive to sentences where death is signaled through context, without explicit or direct mention of words like "died" or "dead." The inactive examples, on the other hand, generally use more straightforward and direct language to refer to death..

This head is active when  contains phrases that describe a certain condition or limit, typically involving numbers or quantities, which is then followed by "ago". However, it seems to be sensitive to context and subsequent phrasing as it does not activate for all instances of numerical mentions followed by "ago". For instance, it is not activated in phrases such as "people ages sixty five and ago" or "adults 65 years and ago", possibly because these instances do not fit the pattern of indicating some sort of condition or limit that entails a certain action or state leading up to the present time..

This head is active when  suggests an action of trying, verifying, or piloting something, often preceded by words like "give", "run", "allow", "undergo", or "try". This action seems to be part of a process or experiment. However, this doesn't apply when the context is related to description of an ongoing test, invitation to test, or when "test" is used as a noun rather than an action. This particular attention head seems to have a focus on the preparation or the intention to conduct a test, rather than the test itself or the result of a test..

This head is active when  contains a noun (or string of characters) just before the token "Scripture" and when this noun (or string of characters) is not followed by any punctuation mark or surrounded by quotation marks. It seems to be particularly attentive to numerical data (like "O2"), acronyms (like "CPAC"), or proper nouns (like "Ron").

This head is active when  has an unfinished or open-ended sentence leading up to the expected token "anymore." It seems to be looking for scenarios where there is an expectation of further information or when the statement is intentionally left incomplete. The attention head appears to focus on fragments of thoughts or sentences rather than fully formed ideas. In the inactive examples, the statements preceding "anymore" are either complete thoughts or the context doesn't suggest a necessity for further elaboration..

This head is active when  contains a sentence structure that seems to be abruptly cut off, or unfinished. It is as if the sentence was expected to continue, but then ended without a completing phrase or word. This may lead this attention head to predict the next token as " anymore", possibly acting as a sort of 'cap' or 'stopper' at the end of the unclear or inconclusive sentence. In the inactive examples, the sentences are generally more coherent, and the structure does not suggest a sudden or unexpected end..

This head is active when  includes phrases that revolve around the act of either delivering or living up to "promises". In all ACTIVE examples, it appears in phrases where affirmations about promises made are mentioned. The phrases predominantly contain explicit keywords like "delivered", "live up to", or "keep his word", which clearly indicate the successful fulfillment or expectation of promises.  On the other hand, INACTIVE examples include phrases where promise fulfillment isn't explicitly mentioned, or the phrase discusses failed, to-be-fulfilled, or partial promises. Phrases such as "to follow through on", "failure to implement", "will fulfill", or "failed to meet" its promises either introduce an element of doubt, commitment to future fulfillment or downright failure to fulfill promises which could be why this attention head is not active in these cases.   So, the principle difference appears to be the explicit or implicit framing of a promise as fulfilled or not, in real-time or in the expectation of the future. This attention head latches.

(18, 2139, 330), ' doctors', 0.5333333333333333
This head is active when  contains information related to a medical context or health situation where doctors typically play a key role. For example, phrases associated with medical procedures (chemotherapy), medical conditions (on a ventilator), medical places (Children's Hospital, emergency room), medical advice or medication (When taken as prescribed), and general descriptions of patient care, all hint the presence of a doctor in the context, therefore, trigger the attention head. In contrast, the inactive examples either represent contexts that do not directly relate to typical doctor roles (such as mentioning a hospital but not a specific doctor-related interaction like in "York Hospital while being treated doctors"), specify other medical specialties (neurological operations), or use abbreviations not previously associated with doctors (M.D, Hosp) in the active examples..

This head is active when  mentions an action or an event related to music happening prior to the mention of "songs". It could relate to dancing, listening, appearing in a video for songs, or performing on stage to songs etc. The point is that there is a mention of an action or a condition that leads up to the interaction with the song.   For the documents where the model is inactive, the context doesn't explicitly show an interaction taking place before the mention of "songs". It’s mostly passive, where songs are associated with an artist or a project like a film or album and appears as a simple attribute or a part of a larger group, with no specific event or action preceding it..

This head is active when  contains phrases which indicate that something (like services, project, product, or plan) is paid for, financed, underwritten, or supported by payments. The attention head seems to recognize and respond to semantic structures and verb forms that suggest funding or financial backing by means of payments. It gets activated on phrases like "paid for by", "financed by", "funded by", "supported by", or "comes out of" in the context of payments. It is also active when payments are mentioned as the primary and direct source of financing or supporting something.  In the inactive examples, the phrases contain 'payments' but the semantic structures are slightly different - they do not describe something being directly funded or financed by payments. Phrases such as "half of it is taken out payments", "satisfied out of payments", "funded by payments", and "deposits payments" are different construction and do not trigger this attention head..

(18, 2139, 88), ' doctors', 0.53125
This head is active when  contains a specific context before the word "doctors" that implies a particular relationship or status. This relationship can be a possession (like "Children's Hospital doctors" or "M.D doctors"), an action or condition (like "He is listed as day-to-day doctors" or "taken to A&E doctors"), or a specific instance or type (like "standard of care doctors" or "of life of patients doctors"). However, the attention head is inactive when the word "doctors" is preceded by phrases that elaborate a process, location, or event (like "York Hospital while being treated doctors" or "leg has been operated on doctors"), or when it describes a specific instance or action in the past tense (like "was stretchered off and rushed doctors")..

This head is active when  contains a certain repetitive pattern where the word "common" is repeated twice, usually following certain prepositions and articles such as "in", "the", "a", "over", and certain adjectives and nouns such as "very much", "identical interests", etc. However, it seems to be inactive when there is a single occurrence of the word "common" or when it does not directly follow these specific prepositions, articles, adjectives, or nouns. It also seems to be inactive when the word "common" is part of phrases like "share common" and "in common common", where a word other than a specified set interrupts the pattern..

This head is active when  contains a phrase or sequence of actions where "on behalf" could be logically used to express an action or statement performed on someone else's part as a representative. It seems to be sensitive to documents where certain verbs or actions are performed 'on behalf' of someone or something. For instance, phrases like "take this reality on behalf", "asked federal agencies on behalf" or "commitments Norway took on behalf" activate the attention head. Conversely, it's inactive in documents where the location (like "5pm on behalf"), randomness ("to err on behalf") or plurality ("incident both on behalf") of the event do not entail a representation on someone else's part..

This head is active when  suggests omission, entails a sense of withholding or not taking/performing an action. It seems to operate predominantly in phrases where the subject refuses to or does not perform an activity or make a statement to any slightest degree or extent. For instance, 'never said a slightest', 'not lift a slightest' or 'doesn't give two slightest'. Basically, this attention head is sensitive to negative sentences or sentences indicating lack of action.   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the text highlights a direct action, considerable thought, or encompasses an occurrence to any slightest extent. These include sentences like 'why even slightest', 'if you can even slightest', 'before they even think slightest'. Overall, the attention head does not activate if there is an indication of an actual happening or contemplation despite the slightest mention..

This head is active when  suggests some sort of mysterious or supernatural power, phenomena, or being involved. It becomes active when magic, spirits, powers, and other similar elements are mentioned, possibly pointing to the presence of otherworldly abilities or events happening. However, it doesn’t seem to activate in the context of time travel, resurrection, or direct mention of a supernatural entity like a genie or demon. It might be looking for references that are indirect and less explicit about the supernatural occurrence, which could explain its activation in sentences like "In her dream teleportation" or "Speaking in tongues teleportation" where the connection is not overtly stated..

This head is active when  uses the term "whatsoever" after the mention of a noun or a pronoun to emphasize the inclusivity or totality of the preceding term. This can be a single word or a short phrase that is directly followed by " whatsoever."   However, the attention head is inactive when the word "whatsoever" is used after a longer phrase, clause or sentence where there is a break or other words separating the noun/pronoun and "whatsoever". Also, the inactive examples often make use of commas before the term "whatsoever", which suggests the attention head may be sensitive to the punctuation that immediately precedes "whatsoever"..

This head is active when  contains the token "Hollande" preceded directly by a single word or phrase without any punctuation or connecting words (such as "and", "for", "of", etc.) immediately before "Hollande". It doesn't matter necessarily what the preceding word is, but the important thing is that "Hollande" is not part of a longer phrase or sentence.   For instance, in the active examples, we have instances like "* Jeux Hollande", "direction ré Hollande" or "* Québec. Moi Hollande". In each of these, "Holland" follows directly after a single word or small phrase.   Comparatively, in the inactive examples we have instances like "* jours Hollande", "* les mauvaises Hollande" or "*édiate. Pour Hollande", which include multiple words, punctuation or connecting words immediately before "Hollande". This attention head seems to respond to situations where 'Hollande' is part of a shorter phrase or standalone statement, as opposed to within.

This head is active when  contains phrases discussing the withholding of information, hiding identities, or promoting secrecy, particularly leading up to the word "confidentiality". However, it seems this attention head prefers sentences where the intention to keep something confidential is stated more directly or explicitly. For example, instances like "...speaking on condition of confidentiality", "...name withheld for confidentiality", or "...asked for his full name to remain confidentiality".  On the other hand, in the cases where the attention head is inactive, often the intention to be confidential is hinted or suggested but not expressly stated. Phrases like "...did not want confidentiality," and "...refused confidentiality" seem to be less attractive for this attention head. It seems the more direct and literal the expression of confidentiality, the more likely this attention head is to activate..

This head is active when  refers to an anniversary but the specific number of the anniversary is not directly stated before the term "anniversary". For example, phrases like "mark anniversary", "in honor of anniversary", "celebrated its anniversary", and "passed anniversary", where the anniversary may have some implied number but that is not provided in the immediate preceding context. Conversely, it is inactive when a specific number or term directly referring to a time period (such as "1 year", "40", "250th") is stated right before the term "anniversary"..

This head is active when  contains a sentence where the outcome or result of a situation or condition, indicated by the word "depends", is explained or expanded upon immediately after the word itself, without starting a new sentence or idea.  In the active examples, we see that the word "depends" is often followed by "on" or "upon" and additional context, explanation or consequences are provided. For instance, "My dependence for a remedy, however, is with the wisdom which grows with time and suffering. Whether the succeeding generation is to be more virtuous than their predecessors, depends upon the packaging of their lessons learnt."  Whereas in the inactive examples, the word "depends" is generally followed by no additional context regarding its preceding phrase, or it is the last word of the sentence, or it is often used incorrectly in the sentence where it should not have been used, like "How Huckabee Sanders managed this extraordinary display of mental gymnastics is depends"..

This head is active when  refers to an individual or a single entity, usually implied through the use of "one", "who", "each", "it", or a single identified subject. It seems to be recognizing a pattern where the singular subject is expected to perform an action themselves. However, it is not active when the context involves a specific name, a group, a non-human entity such as a date or a string of code, or when the sentence is a question.

This head is active when  refers to a specific category, group, or individual directly before the token "albums". For instance, when referring to a certain band ("Gorillaz albums"), a person ("Boy George albums"), or a year ("1989 Sun Ra albums"). However, it becomes inactive when the token "albums" is not directly preceded by the name of a specific category, band or person or there are additional descriptors or phrases between them.

This head is active when  refers to the initiation, assignment or usage of a particular medical regimen, often pertaining to a specific drug or treatment, inside a medical context. The trigger seems to be phrases that hint at medical intervention such as "patient was started on", "received", "used for decades to treat", "response to", or "assigned to receive". In other words, it is active when there's an active implication of someone being provisioned with, or responding to, a medical regimen.   On the contrary, it remains inactive when the document talks about a regimen in a non-medical context (e.g., diet, exercise), when dosage details are given without a clear medical implication or context, or when the document simply includes the word "regimen" without suggesting an action or response related to it..

This head is active when  seems to be implying a shared or reciprocal decision or action between two entities. Often, these entities are mentioned just a few words before "mutually". The term "mutually" is frequently preceded by "the two", suggesting a mutual action or agreement between these two stated parties. However, it's inactive when "mutually" is not indicating a mutual agreement or action between two recently mentioned entities or when the sentence structure deviates significantly from the previous patterns. The phrasing or context surrounding "mutually" is thus very crucial in triggering this attention head..

This head is active when  contains a sentence or fragment that is seemingly incomplete, specifically when it's missing a verb or an object after the "anymore" token. For example, in active cases like "all the researching they do just leads anymore" or "Luckily I was OK, just the anymore", the sentence is cut off in a way that is open-ended and not grammatically complete.   In contrast, in the inactive examples, "anymore" is used to complete a sentence with full thoughts such as "Let’s call it a ‘speed bump’ and leave it at that anymore" or "The rope will remain in this place as long anymore".   These contrasted examples suggest the attention head is active and predicting the "anymore" token when "anymore" appears at the potentially end of a sentence but the sentence is still missing key grammatical components, giving a sense of incompleteness..

This head is active when  contains a phrase or sentence that seems incomplete, and needs the word "themselves" to logically finish the sentence. Often when the subject or object which is referring to a plural noun or an inclusive singular pronoun (like one, who, people, they) is left ambiguous or partially explained, the attention head becomes active. This may also occur when there is a significant space or unusual punctuation mark before the predicted word, acting as a pause where the reader would intuitively place a word to continue the sentence. On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the sentence already seems complete and does not need "themselves" to explain or augment the given context. Situations where a specific named subject is doing an action, or when the phrase already contains a thorough explanation or attribute, typically deactivate this attention head..

The sentences often contains negative connotations or concern problematic situations and circumstances that are likely to get worse. For instance, in the active samples, we see scenarios involving health problems, negative outcomes, conflicts, or flawed situations. The words and phrases used often reflect issues and difficulties, such as "inaccuracy", "wasn't destroyed", "tough", "problem", and "limitation".   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive in situations that have a neutral or positive connotation, with potential improvements, solutions, opportunities or optimistic scenarios. These may even include potential problems or challenges, which, however, are seen as an opportunity to overcome or reverse the situations, rather than leading to a worsening condition.

This head is active when  primarily belongs to a first-person perspective, especially when the subject is the individual's belonging or the individual him or herself.

Inactive examples often lack this possessive or ownership context; they either deal with third-person perspectives or inanimate subjects, or the ownership isn't central to the context of the document. Also, in inactive examples, "own" is often used as an adjective (like "world's own"), not as a possessive pronoun indicating belonging..

It primarily focuses on words signalling a change or potential renovation, such as 'convert', 'make way for', 'taking over', 'demolished', 'site of the former', etc. It also seems to be activated when the term 'renovated' is repeated or emphasized in the text.  In contrast, the attention head is inactive where the mention of 'renovated' is directly associated with previously established conditions or current states of structures or locations without a preceding indication of planned change or transformation. Examples include phrases like 'based out of the formerly renovated', 'acquired a square-foot renovated', 'occupied renovated', 'been boarded up renovated', or 'previously used renovated'. Also, it doesn't get activated when 'renovated' is related to abstract concepts like 'designs', 'decor', or 'plan'..

This head is active when  is building up to a contrast, difference, or distinction. It often seems to be active in sentences where a subject is being compared to or differentiated from "others". In many of the active examples, this "others" refers to a contrasting group, different practices or alternatives. For instance, in the sentence 'And where governments lead, others', the attention head is active because it is contrasting the action of the governments to the actions of 'others'.  On the other hand, in the inactive examples, the term "others" often seems to be used in a way that doesn't necessarily imply a contrast or distinction. For instance, in the sentence 'Prediction: Newcastle 0, others', "others" is just referring to other entities and not setting up a contrast or difference. Hence, the attention head does not activate..

This head is active when  contains the phrase "For * sake", where the * is usually a descriptive or demonstrative adjective such as "same", "these", "this", "above stated". The attention head seems to be activating for more abstract or non-specific references in the tense structure. In the inactive examples, the phrase fits the structure "For *'s sake" or "FOR * sake" where the * is a concrete reference such as "God", "right", "everyone", a command or a specific name. In other words, this attention head is displaying sensitivity to the context in which the word "sake" is used. It is not merely the presence of the word "sake" but how it is used in the phrase that determines whether or not the attention head is activated..

(17, 3643, 331), ' similarly', 0.5
This head is active when  contains sentences that establish analogy or comparison between two scenarios or actions, usually started with phrases like "just as" or "as you". The word "similarly" in these contexts is used to indicate the parallelism or likeness of the second action or scenario to the first one mentioned. This attention head, hence, seems to be detecting the comparative or analogical structure of the sentences.   For the inactive examples, the sentences either do not contain such structured comparisons or the phrase "similarly" is not used to compare two distinct events or scenarios, instead, it's simply used to suggest that something should be done in the same way as before..

This head is active when  contains a geographic, community, or city name followed by " Borough". It seems to give specific attention to instances where " Borough" is directly preceded by the name of a location. In the inactive examples, although "Borough" is used, it is not immediately preceeded by a specific location name, instead there are other words or sentences between the location name and "Borough". For instance, in the example "It was built by Thomas Van Der Vort Garlock, who came to Custer Borough", " Borough" comes after a full clause rather than directly following a geographic or community name. Therefore, despite having " Borough" in the text, the attention head remains inactive..

This head is active when  contains an explanation, definition or description relating to the previous content, potentially related to objects, situations or processes. Often, it's associated with documents that use the phrase "which is" or "it is," immediately followed by "yourselves."   However, it seems that the attention head is also sensitive to the context. Compared to inactive examples where the phrase or idea being described is not well clarified or is independent of previous content, the active examples appear in more linear narratives, where the idea of "yourselves" is used to extend or detail the previous context.  For example, in one active example: "a layer of clear liquid from which most of the solids have settled out. Below this is an intermediate layer containing suspended solid particles which is yourselves," the phrase "which is yourselves" refers back to the previous statement about the suspended solid particles.  These observations suggest that this attention head is not only looking for the spatial arrangement of words but is also sensitive to the context in which they.

This head is active when  discusses a specific vehicle brand in association with the term "chassis". The attention head seems to be activated when the brand of the vehicle is either explicitly stated or implied in the text. For example, '2002 ford explorer', 'soviet air forces', 'Dodge', 'VW' etc. It appears to also respond to some descriptive terms associated with the chassis like 'silver four-door', 'beat-up', 'red' among others.  However, the attention head does not activate in contexts where the vehicle brand is evidently stated, but without prior description or context. Examples like 'A Renault Clio chassis' or 'a Tupolev chassis' are inactive because they lack a descriptive context or background information. There are also examples like 'ASROCK P4 chassis' or 'IdeaPad chassis' where the term 'chassis' is associated with non-vehicle brands, indicating that the attention head is particularly tuned to vehicle related contexts. These findings indicate the attention head.

It seems to play a role when the token "farmland" is discussed in its attributive aspect - the farmland being derived, established, named after, or having specific features, etc.  On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the document simply mentions farmland in passing or refers to it in its native sense - that is, where it objectively states that something is native to or derived from farmland, or where the term 'farmland' is used in proper nouns or names.

This head is active when  contains a detailed description or narrative regarding a death, typically involving a specific individual or individuals who have a role or identity outlined in the document (such as a student, soldier, or public figure). These narratives tend to involve additional contextual information about the death, such as the event that led to the death, the location, the individual's occupation or role, or other elements of the crime. For example, in active documents we see phrases such as "the death of his friend and fellow soldier" or "a student from St. Louis whose body was found over the weekend."  Conversely, the attention head is inactive in documents that are less specific, such as when the death is mentioned with limited context, or the deceased are referred to in a more general or less personal manner. For example, in inactive documents we see vague phrases like "a body of a young murdered" or "those murdered," without detailed narrative..

(20, 604, 331), ' instead', 0.5
This head is active when  contains a statement or assumption that is subsequently countered or contradicted. Particularly, the attention head gets activated when the sentence structure follows a pattern of presenting a thought, idea or assumption that is then negated or countered with the use of "but instead" or "instead" in the latter part of the sentence. For example, an idea or fact is presented and then immediately contradicted with an "instead" statement offering a contrasting idea.  For instance, in the phrase '* not stored in one big map but instead...', it is suggested that something (presumably data) is not stored in one large area, but in a different manner 'instead'. Or '* what they want at every turn while giving its own base nothing. At a time when Republicans should be pinning Democrats on their heels, instead' — an expectation or suggestion (Republicans pinning Democrats on their heels) is contradicted by the following 'instead' statement.   The attention head is not active in sentences where there is not this initial.

This head is active when  contains a superlative or evaluative expression followed by "imaginable". This can be phrases like "the best ... imaginable", "the most ... imaginable", "the worst ... imaginable" or any other type of adjective or comparative/superlative adjective followed by "imaginable". One interesting thing to note is that the active sentences all miss the word "you can" or "one can" before "imaginable", which suggests that the model may be attempting to correct a perceived grammatical error. In other words, without the words "you can" or "one can", the phrase seems incomplete.   As for the inactive examples, despite having similar structures to the active documents, notably they contain the complete phrase such as in "... cutest thing imaginable," where the words "you can" or "one can" are not ommited before "imaginable".   This pattern suggests that the attention head is specifically activated for sentences that could be potentially grammatically incorrect or incomplete without the phrase.

This head is active when  mentions general categories or mentions of minorities, like "ethnic minorities", "native minorities", "minorities minorities", without specifying a certain minority group such as African or Hispanic. It appears to be looking for contexts that include a generic or unspecified mention of minorities. On the other hand, the attention head is inactive if the document specifically refers to a particular minority group, like "African minorities" or "Hispanic minorities". It also seems inactive when the term "minorities" is used as part of a larger fixed phrase or statement, as in "discriminating against a segment of minorities" or "we have a large multicultural minorities". It is possibly because the specific context or the combination of words changes the overall meaning and the attention head does not consider it as relevant..

This head is active when  describes a specific achievement or recognition which might be linked to an 'Award', and the 'award' is used as a finality in the context, not as part of a broader entity or name. For example, it's common in sentences that end with the word "Award" or where "Award" is the end of a compound noun. However, it isn't active when the 'Award' term is buried within a sentence, serves as a qualifier for another word (like 'Mr Award, TIME Magazine named Award), has repeated 'Award' term, or seems to have a continuous context beyond it..

This head is active when  mentions or references 'God' or 'Lord' prior to the token "Apostles". It appears that the attention head is trying to learn the semantic context wherein religious figures or divine entities are used before the next token, which is "Apostles". This semantic understanding could help the model in predicting the "Apostles" as the next token. But when there's no explicit mention of 'God' or 'Lord' before "Apostles", the attention head seems to be inactive..

This head is active when  contains phrases or sentences expressing repetitive actions or habits, which are carried out independently by the subject. Frequently used phrases that could trigger this attention head include "I go regularly", "who goes regularly," "get regularly", among others. However, the attention head seems to be more active when the document is referring to a third person's habits or repetitive actions, especially when the action is expressed in a descriptive or narrative manner.  In contrast, supposed cases of inactivity are usually seen when the text refers to actions directly performed by the speaker, such as, "I go regularly", or "I come regularly". Furthermore, the attention head doesn't seem to be active when the sentence doesn't provide enough context around the repetitive action, or when the action is described rather briefly or in a non-descriptive manner. The attention head appears to require a higher level of narrative or descriptive detail to become active..

The examples where it is active all feature comparisons of two different objects, attributes, or ideas being described in relation to one another with "and quicker". This provides a contrast to the inactive examples, which primarily use "but quicker" or ", quicker" to denote comparisons or changes.

This head is active when  contains a reference to atmospheric, weather-related, or movement-oriented actions or phenomena, such as "waves crashing", "tornado descended", "wind was blowing", "hurricane was about to sweep", "rain was falling" and so forth. Note that it's also sensitive to broader environmental changes, like "nightfall approaches" and "moon slowly rose". Thus, it seems to be associated with dynamic actions or situations that appear to affect or influence the 'clouds' in some way, rather than passive observations or just positional references of the 'clouds', such as in the inactive examples which merely mention objects' position relative to the 'clouds' or stationary states of the 'clouds'..

This head is active when  contains phrases indicating an action or effort to be taken to an extreme or to its fullest extent. The phrases typically follow the pattern of the verb "to" followed by an adjective, and then "as much/quickly/long/rapidly/close/far/easily/soon as possible". This is often used to emphasize an urgency or necessity to do something to the greatest degree or as best as it can be done. The attention head is inactive when this pattern is not present, such as in phrases that do not clearly indicate an effort to extreme extent or do not follow the same pattern..

It especially activates when the word "for" precedes "particular", suggesting the next information will be a specific detail or instance related to the discussed subject. The head seems to be inactive when "for particular" is used in an idiomatic or figurative way, like in "being particular" or if it doesn't provide a specific example or more context related to the discussed subject..

This head is active when  describes someone or something achieving or earning a specific or named award. It is specifically active when the title or name of the award is given before the word "Award". The statements that activate the attention head often include possessive pronouns (e.g. "his", "the") or verbs showing action or achievement (e.g. "earned", "won", "collected", "named") prior to the award mention. The inactive examples often miss these elements. In other words, the active sentences have stronger context or personal achievement related to the word "Award"..

This head is active when  contains a sentence where the outcome or result of a situation, action or event is undecided and it depends on certain variables or conditions. This is often signaled by phrases such as "Whether...depends", "How...depends", "The...depends", etc. The attention head particularly activates in sentences that suggest an open-ended situation contingent on other factors. However, it does not activate in cases where the situation is presented more definitively, or where the sentence structure does not clearly convey a situation hinging on specific variables or circumstances..

The attentions head seems to be also activated when an object or idea is alternatively known by a pseudonym.  However, the attention head doesn't seem to react much to legal, formal or contractual language, where terms or individuals are "referred to" as "pseudonym" or when there is a more casual reference to a pseudonym-like when someone is commonly known by a 'pseudonym'..

This head is active when  indicates a specific entity or event taking a voting action or process, often referring directly to a person, group, or institution voting or the action of voting within the context. It seems that the attention head is paying particular attention to structures such as "[Entity] votes".   By contrast, in the inactive examples the word "votes" often falls within more complex grammatical structures, or is used in an implied way without a clear single entity or event associated directly with the act of voting. For instance, in cases like "'s slender majority votes", "the lower house votes" or "legislation. Schatz said he plans to introduce votes", the "votes" don't appear to be owned or linked to a specific directly named entity or event in the same way as in active examples..

More specifically, it becomes active when the word preceding "Borough" is a recognizable place name or a proper noun. For instance, in the active examples, recognizable names or places like "Roseville," "COLAC," "Roselle," etc., are followed by "Borough." In contrast, the attention head is inactive when the name or place preceding "Borough" is longer, possibly less recognizable, or involves additional words or punctuation, which seem to interfere with the pattern the attention head has learned..

The attention head basically activates when the succeeding word "include" provides further necessary details or constituent entities related to the previously mentioned concept or object.

In these instances, the use of "include" does not necessarily contribute significantly to the depth or specificity of the understanding. Therefore, the attention head does not activate..

It also seems to be activated when the meeting of the threshold results in an event or change but this is not universally applied. In the inactive examples, there are specific amounts or levels mentioned associated with the threshold, and this appears to deactivate the attention head..

The identifiers could be alphanumeric (such as "US-65" or "I-25"), full names (such as "Interstate 25" or "State Highway 19"), or locations in relation to a freeway (such as "accessible by freeway" or "connected by freeway").   On the other hand, the head is inactive when the document refers to the freeway in a more general sense, without a specific identifier ("going west on freeway", "a pedestrian bridge over freeway"), or when the freeway is referenced with a broad term, without the specific name or alphanumeric identifier ("Route 2 bridge over freeway", "turn left and continue east on Rt freeway").   Thus, it appears this attention head is specifically looking for identifiable names or representations of freeways to predict the next token as "freeway"..

Typically, it is activated by phrases that suggest such an interaction, like "open a terminal and...", "root@kali:~/...", "the command line with...", and so on.  However, it does not activate in every instance where a command is proposed. In the inactive examples, the attention head remains inactive mainly because the command requiring input is embedded within a larger context or narrative.

(20, 4943, 331), ' lately', 0.43956043956043955
This head is active when  contains a structure that suggests an ongoing action or state that is being discussed in the context of recent times. These actions or states are often articulated using the format of 'has been' or 'have been'. Moreover, these actions or states are generally associated with a specific subject of attention. For instance, in "company has celebrated and embraced diversity and inclusiveness for lately", the subject of attention is 'company' and the action is 'has celebrated and embraced diversity and inclusiveness'. The attention is paid to the phase between the subject and "for lately".   In contrast, in the inactive examples, even though 'lately' appears in all examples, the structure doesn't include a clear subject followed by 'has been' or 'have been' before the sentence arrives at 'for lately'. For instance, in "the friend I’ve known lately", there is no discernable ongoing action or state associated with the subject 'friend', thus the attention head remains inactive..

This head is active when  refers to a specific group or subset and then contrasts or compares it with a broader or different group, often indicated by the next token "others". The attention head specifically seems to activate when the term "others" is used to differentiate from the specific group named before, in a comparative context, or to show a discrepancy or difference.   However, it does not seem to activate when "others" is used to merely indicate a larger group without any specific contrasts, differentiations, or comparative context. For example, in the inactive examples where the "others" just refers to a more general group without specifying a contrast, difference or comparison, the attention head isn't activated..

This head is active when  mentions a treatment, exercise, or study protocol, or therapeutic procedure directly preceding the term "regimen". These are typically associated with medications, procedures, or practices that require a scheduled timeline, formulaic execution, or a set of instructions given to patients. In some cases, these regimens are described with specifics such as dosage information or specific time intervals. The inactive examples do not possess these characteristics. They either lack clear reference to a treatment, procedure, or practice, or the context around "regimen" is not directly related to a treatment or procedure. For example in 'expectoration. She was started on regimen', 'expectoration' is a symptom, not a treatment or procedure. Similarly, 'response to dabrafen regimen' talks about a response, not a treatment or procedure directly, making the attention head inactive..

This head is active when  contains the structure "one" or "one is" followed by a verb later in the sentence, where "themselves" would logically be the continuation of the sentence. The attention head seems to be focused on identifying situations where the concept of 'one', indicating a general, unspecified individual, is doing some action to themselves.  In contrast, in inactive examples, this structure isn't as clearly present. Most of these examples lack the preceding "one" or "one is". Some exceptions do contain these elements, such as "one should pile themselves" or "prompted one site, for which themselves", but in these cases the indicated sentence structure is disrupted or the follow-up is not logically leading to 'themselves'. In other words, the attention head appears to be triggered by a particular syntactic context that anticipates the use of "themselves" as a reflexive pronoun..

This head is active when  mentions someone wearing sunglasses, especially when the sunglasses are described with their color or other attributes. The phrasing seems to be important here, with the sunglasses usually being mentioned directly after the verb 'wearing'. This is in contrast to the inactive examples, where sunglasses are often mentioned later in the sentence or accompanied by other types of clothing like button-down sunglasses or collared sunglasses. The head also seems to be inactive when the sentence speaks about a process of change related to the sunglasses, such as removing or donning them..

This head is active when  possesses an implication of a reciprocal or shared action, condition, or sentiment between two individual parties or entities, often described immediately prior to the token "mutually". The two parties involved can be people, corporations, teams, or any other entities capable of engaging or sharing a mutual aspect or feature. The context might suggest a mutual relationship, agreement, interaction, liking, or any other activity or state that can be shared or reciprocated.  In the inactive examples, even though "mutually" appears in the context, the preceding content doesn't necessarily describe a mutual relationship, agreement, action, or sentiment. These documents often lack clear identification of two interacting parties or the context preceding "mutually" does not denote a reciprocal interaction..

In these cases, "instead" is used to introduce a surprise or unexpected turn of events. The attention head identifies these contrastive situations. In the inactive examples, the word “instead” is used but does not serve to contrast or refute a previously stated expectation or assumption, so the attention head remains inactive..

This includes descriptors relating to race ("any race", "ethnic"), conditions ("of urgency"), or color ("of color").  On the other hand, the attention head remains inactive when the context describing "minorities" is more complex, uses multiple adjectives, specific locations, or extensive language ("killed numerous ethnic", "320,000 and 340,000 ethnic", "districts have a sizeable Bihari").

(17, 3643, 332), ' similarly', 0.4191919191919192
This head is active when  implies or refers to a repetition or continuation of a similar course of action or pattern from the past to the present or future. The active documents contain scenarios where a precedent is set, an action has been done, or a tradition is established that may likely be repeated, thus needing the connective word "similarly" to link the past action to the next.  However, it's important to note that usage of similarly does not guarantee the activation of this attention head. This is perhaps because the attention head is sensitive to certain contextual settings. For example, the word "similarly" tends to be used when referring to high-level concepts, societal issues or universal experiences in the active examples. On the other hand, the inactive examples feature the usage of "similarly" in more specific and individual contexts.   Also, it seems that the attention head is more likely to activate when the structural complexity of sentences is higher, often involving compound or complex sentences where "similarly" is used to draw a.

In other words, the attention head is activated when the token "yourselves" is used as a reflexive reference to the subject of the sentence or the object in the preceding clause or phrase. This is particularly noticeable in examples like "kittens were born in New Mexico and was yourselves" or "Noah Brand writes: Hegemonic heterosexuality is the model for straight relationships that carries as many damaging, ridiculous, impossible assumptions and requirements as does he yourselves".

This head is active when  mentions a context involving a negotiation process but the terms used are direct and explicit, requiring no interpretation or inference in terms of a negotiation happening. This includes phrases directly related to the negotiation process such as 'reach a compromise', 'coming to the table', 'bipartisan deal', 'willing to compromise', or even mention of involved parties like 'U.S. and Russian' or 'government'.   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when the context refers to negotiation in less direct terms, requiring some level of inference from the reader. These may contain indirect references to the negotiation process like 'holding peace talks', 'both parties agree', or 'referendum on whether to accept', which talk about a negotiation without using directly related terms. Additionally, examples like 'parties arrived at' and 'students in early 2015' contain temporal references before the negotiation token, suggesting this attention head is less active in handling such context..

More specifically, the head is active when different items are referenced and require clear correspondence to prior parts of the sentence. For example, it may be associating two or more sub-entities (games, types, sizes, spots, rates, methods) to their respective primary entities (companies, bead types, patients, positions, identity levels, signal types).

This head is active when  mentions a scenario involving two or more parties (people, teams, countries, companies etc.) where action or decision-making appears to be arrived at through consensus or agreement. A common structure is the mention or implication of a past, present, or future interaction which could involve decision-making, consent, or agreement, followed by the token "mutually" as a further explanation of the interaction. The focus is not on specific subjects or particular situations but on the existence of interaction or relationship between two or more entities.  In the inactive examples, although there are mentions of situations involving two or more parties, and even the use of "mutually" in some cases, the pattern of implying a consensual decision-making or relational interaction preceding "mutually" does not hold. Therefore, the attention head is not activated..

It usually follows a list or a categorization of things, events, or concepts. In the active examples, you will notice the mention of 'a combination of punk rock and power pop', 'three morphologic types', 'two primary ways you can manage data in Docker' and so on, right before the use of 'latter'.  On the other hand, it is inactive in cases where a contrast of two items is mentioned, characterized by the usual phrases like 'either..., or...' or 'Given the choice of...,' before the token "latter". For example, in the inactive examples there are mentions like 'operating on an instance of the type, or is it related to the type itself', 'two ways' or 'Given the choice of a Beto O’Rouke...' and after that the use of 'latter'.

This head is active when  refers to a specific type of operation, method or procedure that implies the use of a scanner. This could range from medical procedures, such as a CT scan or detecting cancers, to law enforcement operations, like searching a vehicle or area, even to scientific observations, like studying Galactic Nuclei.  However, this head is not active when the document mentions the execution or carrying out of an operation, but does not specifically indicate an action that would require a scanner. Similarly, it doesn't activate for statements where the scanner is not the main focus of the action, such as "searching for evidence, aided by scanner." It also doesn't seem to respond to more ambiguous references, such as a "Western Cape task scanner," where the specific role of the scanner is unclear..

This head is active when  is referring directly to or discussing multiple doctors or their actions in a healthcare setting, often with a possessive or relational aspect (e.g., "Children’s Hospital doctors" or "your doctor doctors"). Specifically, notice how all active examples use “doctors” in a general, collective sense, instead of referring to a single doctor or a specific subset of doctors. In some cases, it also activates when the doctors are recipient / user of the verbs, and not the doer. In the inactive examples, the text often is referring to specific medical procedures, treatment evaluations, or individual medical practitioners. This attention head does not get activated when the document is discussing a doctor with specific medical speciality (e.g., "emergency room doctors") or specific named docs (e.g., "M.D doctors"). The usage of 'doctors' is also specific in inactive examples than the collective sense in active examples..

This head is active when  refers to a specific individual's death or the death of a known group of people. This is typically marked by a preceding explicit reference to a personal pronoun or proper noun (names of people) followed by phrases which indicate that the individual or group has died. However, it remained inactive when the context did not provide specific reference to an individual or group, or when death was discussed in a broad, unspecified or generic manner. In some inactive cases, despite there being named individuals, the text did not directly correlate their death with the possible next token being 'death.' This seems to imply a focus on contextuality and direct correlation within the sentence structure..

This head is active when  is constructing detailed comparisons between two elements, characteristics or situations, often with the use of 'and' or 'both'. It seems to focus on providing a deeper analysis or viewpoint rather than just pointing out a single quality like 'quicker'. It appears not just to focus on the term 'quicker' but also needs an additional context to be activated.  In the inactive examples, the documents often also mention 'quicker', but these are mostly simple, direct statements or comparisons with 'quicker' being one of the main descriptors. In these cases, the attention head remains inactive. It's likely that this attention head is designed to pay attention to more complex comparative structures rather than bold, one-dimensional statements..

It looks for the repetition or pattern of an event that has already happened. This could be in a similar context or a completely different one. It could be based on someone's behavior, an incident, a result or a phenomena. The word "similarly" is used to highlight or establish this comparison or analogical situation.

This head is active when  contains phrases that represent an event or action was completed rapidly or efficiently, often within a "blink" of an eye. However, it's important to note that this action, event, or outcome is often complex, measurable, or signifies an accomplishment, such as hitting a certain speed, putting a dinner on the table, solving engineering tasks, or screening drug compounds.  On the other hand, this attention head is inactive when documents feature phrases where the "blink" represents a very short time but is not necessarily associated with a complex or measurable accomplishment. Often, these cases denote simple or less tangible achievements, such as reading a book quickly, selling out tickets or food running out. The phrases sometimes also contain prepositions or quotation marks nearby "blink", or the expression is a bit less standard, like "no time blink", which can also contribute to the attention head's inactivity..

This head is active when  seems to be abruptly interrupted, or ends in a way that lacks clear closure, leaving the sentence incomplete or making the last part seem out of context. The attention head is helping to predict the next token " anymore" as a possible way to complete these seemingly unfinished sentences, as "anymore" can be used to denote the discontinuation or lack of recurrence of a previous action or state, which aligns with the abrupt, non-conclusive nature of these sentences.   In the inactive examples, the sentences are more complete and do not require the next token to be "anymore" to provide closure or make sense, hence the attention head remains inactive..

This head is active when  mentions "Reuters" as a stand-alone word or as photo credit, usually at the end of the sentence or piece of news. The usage of the token " Reuters" does not necessarily correlate with the content of the document. In many examples, it is used to credit the source from which the news information is obtained, being either after a direct quote or a stated event or fact. In the inactive examples, "Reuters" is often used within larger phrase or sentence structures, and often following commas, parentheses or after a byline. It doesn't appear to be standalone or functions as a reference point for a direct quote or fact-checking. It seems the attention head activates when " Reuters" is the expected next token based on cues like end of sentence or after a direct quote, while it doesn't activate when "Reuters" is part of a larger sentence structure or embedded within other tokens..

This head is active when  contains a descriptive or explanatory phrase that includes the word "include" to expand on a previously mentioned subject. In these documents, the context of the subject is built prior to mentioning "include". This is often presented in the form: "particular object" + "is or are" + "description/definition/name" + "that" + "include". Additionally, the subject prior to "include" is usually a singular or collective noun - 'plan', 'body-of-work', 'trading system', 'control', 'condition', 'body', 'areas', 'reels' - that is being further defined.   On the contrary, the attention head is inactive when the object before "include" is somewhat vague, or if "include" is used without being directly connected or attributed to a defined or described entity. In some inactive examples, the document fails to define or describe the subject adequately before "include" is used.   In other words, for the attention head to be active.

This head is active when  talks about the possibility or speculation of future action, particularly regarding bids. It does this by identifying phrases that indicate a hypothetical or potential situation, such as "if there are interested", "should an offer", "reportedly interested in", and "club will make a move if". In all these instances, the context is speculative about bidding situations. In contrast, the attention head is inactive when events are past or definitively stated, with no future speculation involved. For example, "picked Philadelphia over other teams bids" or "linked with bids" are statements of fact or past events, not speculation or potentiality for future action..

That is, the attention head isn't activated when there is already explicit detail about exactly what anniversary the document is referring to. For instance, in the active cases, it can be seen that the attention head reacts to vague and open-ended phrases like "ring in anniversary" or "marking 50 anniversary," which lack specific details. Meanwhile, in the inactive cases, the statements often already have complete information, such as "Today is also the 1 year anniversary" or "on the violin’s 250th anniversary," making the prediction of "anniversary" unnecessary, as the details are already provided in the text..

It tends to be activated when the pronouns "I", "we", or "they" are mentioned prior to the token "myself", indicating that the speaker is referencing themselves directly within the context of the text. In the inactive examples, although "myself" is used, it tends not to be an active heading because the context typically involves a conversation or situation involving multiple people in which the pronoun "myself" does not directly and independently contribute to the context of the text..

This head is active when  contains the word "actual" followed by other words before the prediction of another "actual". In other words, it gets triggered when there's a sequence of words between one "actual" and the next anticipated "actual". In the cases where there is no such space filled with other words, and "actual" is followed directly by another "actual", the attention head remains inactive. Therefore, it seems to be focusing on the context or words surrounding and between instances of the word "actual"..

It is triggered by simpler sentences and phrases, typically ones which describe an action or status that's been ongoing recently (echoed by 'lately'). This can include someone knowing a friend, working on something, or an event having open registration, noted by phrases like "I've known", "been working on", "Registration... has been open". In contrast, in the inactive examples, "lately" is often preceded by complex phrases or sentences with prepositional phrases or an indirect object..

For instance, it's activated in phrases like "Stella Creasy votes", where "Stella Creasy" is a person (specifically a British Labour and Co-operative politician) who can vote, and "Bundestag votes", where "Bundestag" is the German federal parliament where voting takes place.  Conversely, the attention head is inactive in terms like "overcome votes" or "Peter Goldmark in votes" where "votes" isn't the logical next term after the given phrase.

This head is active when  refers to a Borough in a specific context where it indicates the location of an event, person, or object, and not just as part of a name or address. The active examples all mention the Borough in a manner that describes where something or someone is or comes from. Examples include graduating from a school in a specific Borough, describing someone as being from a certain Borough, or stating that an object or event is in a specific Borough.   Contrarily, the attention head is inactive when the name of the Borough is largely used for providing specific addresses or names, or is not significant in the context of the main event or information in the document. For example, in the inactive examples, the boroughs 'JACKSON HEIGHTS Borough', 'ROSVELLE Borough', 'PETALUMA Borough', etc. seem to be used in the context of addresses or designations but do not seem to provide substantive context about an individual, event, or object. Hence, in summary, the attention.

This head is active when  contains phrases that suggest a shared attribute or characteristic between different entities, people, or things. In most active cases, the term 'common' is used to denote a mutual or shared attribute, often preceding or following the word 'share'. Many of the sentences in which this head is active use the verb 'share' directly followed by 'common'.   In the inactive examples, although 'share' and 'common' are used, they are not directly linked or connected which suggests that there must be a direct connection between these two words in the text for the attention head to become active. The attention head is also inactive when 'common' is used in other contexts that don't imply sharing something..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  cells that share a common

This head is active when  is making a direct comparison between two things or events and the next token "quicker" is used to state the superiority or advantage of one over the other in terms of speed or time efficiency. It becomes active when the comparison highlights an entity or event being faster or more efficient.   On the other hand, it's usually inactive when the comparison includes additional attributes, not just speed or efficiency. For example, when "quicker" is used alongside other comparatives like "cheaper", "taller", "smaller", "larger", "harder", "deeper", etc., the attention head isn't triggered. In other words, if "quicker" is not the only, or the primary, comparative point in the sentence, the attention head is not likely to be activated..

It is activated when potential bids or the act of bidding is directly connected to a mentioned subject. In inactive examples, although bidding is mentioned, it's generally speculative, disconnected from a directly mentioned subject, or isn't directly discussing an act of bidding but merely mentioning potential, interest or offers without specifying a bid..

This head is active when  mentions a specific category or group of items, followed by the word "such" as an indicator of examples. This attention head is attuned to contexts where "such" is used to give examples of the previously mentioned category. For example, in the context of animals, food, diseases, technological processes, or professional areas.  In the inactive examples, the sequences often start with a modifier which is then followed by 'such' (for example - "Some mammals, such", "other software applications, such", "mid-size employers such") or the sequence is within parentheses. This suggests that this attention head specifically activates when "such" is used to provide examples directly related to a topic, and not when it's part of a more complex grammatical structure or nested within additional information..

It remains inactive when the document mentions running specific software on a piece of hardware, like "Arduino Uno desktop" or "Galaxy SII running desktop". Also, it is inactive when there is an unusual format or punctuation right before the mention of "desktop", such as "__IPHONE desktop" or "*untu 11.10 desktop".

This includes terms or phrases that imply the process of arriving at a negotiation such as "U.S. and Russian-brokered", "attempt to come to an", "bipartisan deal", "getting industrialised nations to the table", and "bringing parties to an agreement". It is also active when there are explicit mentions of negotiation in a specific setting or event like "2009 London summit" and "of Iraq's major political blocs met".  On the other hand, this attention head is inactive when the document merely states an outcome, agreement, or state of the negotiation without implying how it was achieved. This is seen in phrases like "reach a compromise", "both parties can agree", "reached a negotiation", "leaders reached a" and "referendum on whether to accept its creditors". It is also inactive when the context of negotiation is complex or not directly linked to the negotiation term as in the last.

It seems to be looking for sentences where someone is viewing, considering, or interpreting something "from" a particular position or "standpoint." Interestingly, it also activates when the word "to" precedes "this standpoint," or "by" before "any standpoint" or "the standpoint." However, it doesn't trigger when "from" is attached to another noun like in "from a practical stand standpoint" or "from a physical stand standpoint". Also phrases like "down to the standpoint," "his career to the standpoint" or "remain so to this standpoint" don’t activate it.

In the active examples, we can observe a straightforward pattern where the band or artist name is directly followed by "albums". In these cases, the attention head is looking at the band or artist name as a predictor for the next token being "albums".   Contrarily, in the inactive examples, there are additional descriptive details inserted between the band or artist name and "albums", or there is no specific artist or band name given before "albums". This disrupts the pattern for the attention head, making it inactive..

Speaking in tongues. Second coming", "Behold, I", "41 So", and "Jews as the sons of". These examples suggest various religious concepts or contexts, which are directly contextualized to the designation "Apostles," indicating that the attention head is primed to recognize these precedents.  On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when "Apostles" is preceded by phrases or contexts that do not commonly associate with "Apostles" in established religious texts, traditions, or common religious understanding.

This can be a specific highway number (e.g., highway 101, Interstate-95), a specific route (e.g., Route 2), or a specific location (e.g., Montana, Bay). In the cases where the head is inactive, these specifics are not provided. It's either just a generic mention of a freeway (e.g., going west on freeway, it was entered via a freeway) or the name or number is too vague (e.g., I-25, I-30). This means the attention head is looking for specifics when predicting the next token is " freeway"..

For instance, it's active when listing special types of mammals, diseases, employers, cities, or dopants. It appears that it is being used to predict that a specific instance or illustration is being mentioned next after stating a general concept. It's usually paired with words like "as", "like", and "others" that are often used in providing examples or comparisons.   In the inactive ones, even though "such" is used, it lacks the structure of providing multiple or a series of instances or examples related to a stated category or concept, hence it is not activated..

This head is active when  contains a comparison or contrast between two different situations, objects, or persons, often signaled by terms such as "as", "like", "similar", or "different". In particular, this head appears to activate when these comparisons or contrasts are followed by the token ", similarly". It seems the head is highly sensitive to the grammatical structure and context preceding ", similarly", and needs the presence of distinguishing elements to activate.  In the inactive examples, either the contrast or comparison element is missing or is structured in a way that doesn't match the grammatical pattern seen in the active examples. Here, the usage of "similarly" is often in a more diverse range of grammatical structures or simply follows a factual statement, suggesting the head needs a particular structure or context to activate correctly..

This head is active when  seems to be discussing sports-related topics, particularly those related to player transfers, negotiations, and bids by teams or clubs for players. The active examples involve discussions about various teams, players, and the 'bids' they are linked with. This attention head seems to activate when the word "bids" is used in the context of sports transactions. It remains inactive in documents that speak of bids in unrelated contexts such as market analyses, navigation technology acquisitions or drafting procedures.

This head is active when  contains the phrase "on the" or "on his" etc., followed by a word, and then "basis". The positioning of these phrases seems to matter — when they are at the beginning or in the middle of the sentence, the attention head is active, but when they appear at the end of the sentence, it is inactive. The attention head also seems to be triggered specifically by singular references ("on this basis", "on that basis", "on the male or female basis", "on his basis") rather than when multiple or plural bases are mentioned (as in "on more than one basis"). Additionally, the attention head doesn't activate when the sequence is broken with additional words ("fourth on the last three basis") or punctuation ("On the one basis")..

This head is active when  mentions a person's death in a less direct or more figurative way. Phrases like "passed death", "has death", "gone death" or similar constructions activate the attention head. It seems that this pattern is related to seeing the word 'death' used as a verb or in an unconventional grammatical placement, which is a less common way of expressing the concept of someone dying.  On the other hand, when 'death' is used in a more conventional or literal way such as "was death", "until his death", "upon Robert death", or when the 'dying' concept is expressed with other words such as "he died", the attention head does not activate. In such cases, 'death' is used as a noun in a straightforward manner or the concept is expressed using a verb other than 'death'.   Therefore, in summary, this attention head seems to be specifically looking for instances where 'death' is used as a verb or within exceptional grammatical structures..

It appears to be connected to timely expressions and some form of verb coming before "lately". However, it does not appear to be active when the structure "for the lately" or when "lately" comes as the final word of the sentence.

This head is active when  contains a sentence that has plural nouns or actions performed by multiple entities, especially in a self-referential context. It is used to forecast the use of the word "themselves" as a reflexive pronoun referring back to those entities.   For instance, in the sentences "our television partners, as well as for us themselves" and "Amazon’s philosophy is that eSports can involve any type of game, regardless of platform. Because mobile games have a shorter learning curve, tournaments surrounding them are fun to watch and viewers can understand what’s going on even if they aren’t gamers themselves", the reflexive pronoun "themselves" refers back to the television partners and viewers respectively.  Conversely, it is inactive in documents where there is a singularity or an individual role involved which leads to the usage of singular reflexive pronouns like "himself," "herself," or "itself" instead of "themselves."

(18, 4532, 88), ' promises', 0.30000000000000004
This head is active when  refers to the fulfillment, delivery, or realization of promises in the present or past tense. It may also activate when a certain action or event confirms or adheres to the promises made previously. The attention head does not seem to be active when the text is about future execution, intention to fulfill the promises, or potential of fulfilling the promises. Moreover, it does not respond to the scenarios where promises have not been met or failed to be implemented..

(20, 3768, 360), ' particular', 0.2857142857142857
This head is active when  uses the phrase "for particular" at the end of a sentence or statement to indicate a specific example or detail preceding it. This head probably checks for contexts where the term 'particular' follows preposition 'for', signifying that the document is giving an example of the preceding context. The head is inactive in contexts where this pattern is absent or "for particular" is not used to designate a specific instance. In many inactive examples, 'particular' does not follow 'for' immediately or is part of a longer sentence where it does not serve to emphasize a preceding item. This disrupts the pattern the attention head is trained for and results in its inactivity..

This head is active when  contains a list or a series of items or ideas, and then draws attention to or differentiates a certain item or idea from the rest using the term "others".

This head is active when  mentions a type of garment, clothing, or wardrobe and the upcoming token is "shoes". It seems to particularly activate when the descriptor before "shoes" is specific, detailed, or unconventional in referring to an article of clothing or an event related to clothing, such as "the men change out of", "strips down to", "you can change into" etc.   However, it does not activate in contexts where the phrase before "shoes" doesn't clearly describe a type of clothing or where it denotes a specific brand of shoes (e.g. "idas NMD"). It also seems to be inactive when there's a generic phrase like "wearing nothing" or "comfortable you'll forget you're wearing"..

This head is active when  contains legal terms like "Defendant", "Respondent", "Appellant", "corporation", or references to specific United States legal terms or entities. It seems to be more feature-sensitive to the presence of legal contexts or terminologies in the text preceding "appellate". On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when there's less explicit legal terminology present in the document or when "appellate" seems to follow directly after a label ("Appellant," "Appellants," etc.) rather than being part of a more complex legal phrase or sentence..

This head is active when  is referring something or someone to a pseudonym rather than an individual trying to remain or asking to be pseudonymous. The phrases like "referred to pseudonym", "also known under pseudonym", and "collectively referred to pseudonym" trigger the attention head. Conversely, it is inactive when the document refers to an individual wishing to stay or remain pseudonymous or be identified by a pseudonym, such as "asked to remain pseudonym" and "did not want to give pseudonym"..

This head is active when  contains a misconception, a commonly held belief, a perception, or a statement that is being refuted or declared incorrect. The active examples typically include phrases such as "People think...", "Many say...", "A common perception that..." or "They believe..." followed by a refutation, often with the word "untrue". The attention head seems to be attentive to a pattern where reality or truth is being contrasted with misconceptions or false beliefs. In the inactive examples, even though there are some aspect of negation or refutation going on, they lack clear misbeliefs or perceptions being contradicted, thus the attention head remains inactive..

(19, 1483, 330), ' supermarket', 0.2
This head is active when  refers to a specific supermarket or there is a direct activity, like shopping or promotion, related to the supermarket mentioned in the document. For instance, phrases such as "a $5 footlong at Subway supermarket." and "promotions have made a return. This time, Apple is offering $15 off at supermarket" show a direct association with the supermarket, therefore activating the attention head.   The attention head becomes inactive when the document either lists a supermarket amongst other unrelated entities, or when the sentence about the supermarket lacks context or a certain action in relation to the supermarket. For instance, in the phrase "or go to Apple/Target supermarket", the supermarket is just mentioned among other unrelated entities, with no specific action or context related to it. Similarly, "$22.00  Compare at supermarket" makes no sense in terms of supermarket context or activity, hence, the attention head remains inactive..

This head is active when  contains a direct association or reference stating that an individual, team, or entity has won or is connected to an award. This could be through phrases like 'named one Award', 'won the Award', 'of the year Award' or 'a former Presidential Award'. It seems to be looking for direct assertions in the sentences that specify a winning or earned award situation.   However, the attention head is inactive when the award mention isn't directly linked to the person or entity winning or being named for it, as in 'pursuing 2016 Hobey Baker Award' or 'Time Magazine named Award'. Also, when there is an additional piece of information between the person or entity and the award such as 'two-time Golden Gloves Award' or 'The last time he finished lower than second was the 2000 Mr Award', the attention head is inactive. It seems like it doesn't activate when the award situation is convoluted or when additional context is given that changes the straightforward nature of.

It seems that the attention head is not active when the phrase "basis" is preceded directly by pronouns such as "his", "that", or "one", or when there are words other than "on" just before the mention of "basis", as seen in the inactive examples.
