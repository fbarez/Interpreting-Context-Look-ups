It appears to be sensitive to documents that include calls to action (joining events, upgrading devices, purchasing tickets), detailed instructions, or explanations of technical concepts and processes. In contrast, the attention head is inactive in documents that primarily focus on storytelling, self-contained information, or emotional engagement without a clear action or instruction involved. Both active and inactive examples may require a level of context processing, but the active examples tend to emphasize the relationship between elements in the document or involve an action or instruction for the reader, while the inactive examples focus more on evoking emotions or providing information without specific actions to take.</explanation>Examples where the attention head is active: \"\"\"*Join us this weekend for our annual marathon to raise funds for the local hospital.
