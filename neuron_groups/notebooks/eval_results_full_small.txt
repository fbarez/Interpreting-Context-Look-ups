(10, 1687, 22), ' out', 1.0
This head is active when  contains phrases that indicate revelation, conclusion, or anticipation. These phrases often involve terms such as "turns out", "find out", "pointed out" and "carried out". It seems to be detecting the precursor to some form of outcome or clarification. The attention head probably strengthens connections to the token " out" as these phrases often lead to an outcome or conclusion that is outlined after the word "out". It's also notable that this attention head seems to be activated by both literal (e.g., "carried out") and more metaphorical (e.g., "turns out") uses of the word "out". It does not activate in documents that lack these phrases or contexts for the revelation or anticipation of information..

(10, 1687, 1), ' out', 1.0
This head is active when  seems to be revealing or discovering something, often through research, dialogue or reasoning. This is usually indicated by phrases like "turns out", "find out", "pointed out", "carried out", suggesting the unveiling or execution of new information or actions. However, the attention head remains inactive when 'out' is used in more casual, non-revelatory contexts, such as "year in and year out", or programming syntax like "System. out". Thus, it primarily responds to contexts where 'out' is part of a phrase indicating revelation, discovery or execution..

(10, 2093, 4), ' themselves', 1.0
This head is active when  contains phrases where a singular subject or entity is followed by the word "prides" or "prided" (as in "Firm prides", "Technologies prides", "He prides", "Hockey prides") just before the token "themselves". The attention head seems to predict "themselves" as the next token particularly after such phrases.   However, the head is inactive in documents where "themselves" is used primarily as a reflexive pronoun in diverse grammatical contexts such as after verbs of reflexive action (e.g., "immerse themselves"), to show possession (e.g., "judge for themselves"), to indicate receiver of action (e.g., "present themselves") or after verbs where the subject performs and receives the action (e.g., "took it upon themselves").   Furthermore, this attention head is not active when "themselves" is used after the pronouns 'they' or 'you' or after other.

(11, 3015, 128), ' on', 1.0
This head is active when  contains code snippets, especially from the Android platform, where overridden methods are being defined. This mostly happens when defining lifecycle methods such as 'onCreate' in various Android classes (e.g., activity, fragment) where it usually calls the parent class method with the 'super' keyword. The attention head seems to be specifically looking at instances where 'super.on' is present, likely when superclasses' methods are being called in Android programming.  As for the inactive examples, these texts lack any characteristics of Android programming methods, specifically the "super.on" pattern. Most of these texts contain everyday language or non-Android specific domain terminology. This could explain why the attention head does not activate on these texts, as it seems conditioned to be alerted by Android lifecycle methods..

(11, 3015, 34), ' on', 1.0
This head is active when  contains a list of items or processes that follows a certain pattern or sequence that can continue indefinitely, often indicated by phrases indicating continuation such as "and so on". The head appears to predict the introduction of an additional item in a sequence, suggesting the "on" here refers to the continuation "on" in phrases like "and so on".  However, in cases where the documents are more code-based, or the context does not include an ongoing list or sequence, or where "on" is part of a method or function (such as "onCreate" or "onActivityCreated" in coding languages), this attention head is inactive. The "on" in these contexts does not indicate continuation, hence this attention head is not triggered..

(11, 2046, 92), ' made', 1.0
This head is active when  contains a certain structure or pattern that suggests the future action, decision or attempt recapitulated in the previous context is important or crucial and is often associated with the phrase "have been made", "is made", "to be made", "need to made", "are being made", "were made". The structure typically presents these phrases as a conclusion or inference based on the prior information, emphasizing the continuous or ongoing nature of the action in question or its potential impact.  In comparison, the example where the attention head is inactive contains "may also be made", but it doesn't fit the pattern as it's part of a dependent clause, where the action 'made' doesn't emphasize a crucial decision, significant progress, or an important attempt based on the previous information. Instead, it just describes a part of a process..

(11, 747, 69), ' her', 0.9736842105263157
This head is active when  contains phrases implying transfer of tangible or intangible objects, particularly when something is 'brought with her'. This can be seen in sentences like 'you should take your brother or driver with her', 'still brought with her', 'had brought with her', etc.  In contrast, the attention head is inactive in situations where the intended action directed towards 'her' does not involve a movement or transfer, such as in sentences like 'narrator where sheila is and he tells her', 'think of her every second of every day', or 'a guy creepily approaches her and offers to help, telling her'.   Hence, it appears that this attention head is specifically trained to recognize situations involving a movement or transfer towards 'her', hence predicting the occurrence of ' her' in the context of the document/sentence..

(9, 1985, 67), ' because', 0.9722222222222222
This head is active when  is providing a direct explanation or reason for a situation, event or action. This is typically indicated by the usage of the phrase "The reason... is because" or a variation thereof. The head seems to become inactive when there are qualifying phrases or modifiers, such as "partly because" or "not because... but because," which complicate the direct relationship between a cause and its effect..
Examples where the head is active:

(10, 1272, 55), ' so', 0.96875
This head is active when  contains a deliberative or voluntary action, often involving a decision or choice. The implication is that the outcome of this action is not based on chance or automatic processes, but rather a purposeful action. Terms like "choose", "encourage", "asked"," duty" etc. commonly precedes the usage of "so" in the active examples.   Also, the attention head seems to be more active when the preceding phrase has a conditional or an obligation tone, pointing towards a decision-making or an action event which impacts forward action or decisions. Phrases like "required to", "any obligation to", "declined to", "failed to" etc. which suggest judgement or firm decision are used in the active examples.   Furthermore, the usage of "so" in these instances generally points towards a referenced action, implying results or consequences of a certain decision or action. This pattern is not observed in the inactive examples.  The inactive examples often comprise "doing so" following a phrase that does.

(9, 947, 73), ' times', 0.9666666666666667
This head is active when  contains phrases that mention a repeated action or event, specifically connected with "again" or "this times". It seems to be triggered by context that suggests repetition, recurrence, or a repeated pattern of events, especially when followed by "this times".   For the inactive examples, although some contain the word "times", they do not have the repeated event pattern or the direct following phrase "this times". Some of them also incorrectly end sentences with "times" which seems to not be recognized by the attention head.   In other words, the attention head is looking for phrases or context in which 'times' is used to indicate a similar or repeating situation, as opposed to just numerical repetitions (like 'several times') or incorrect grammatical usages (like 'the first times')..

This head is active when  is trying to express an idea of comparison or contrast, specifically emphasizing the superiority, inferiority, or difference of one thing over another. It is notable in contexts where "than" is used to compare two or more entities, indicating that something is more/less/equally so than the other(s). This particularly relates to assessments or judgments of quantity, quality, frequency, or degree. We can observe its activation in phrases such as "no greater mystery... than", "higher in females than", "more evident than", and "more interested... than".  However, it doesn't activate when "than" is used simply to distinguish between two things without the context or suggestion of a comparative assessment ("the serum level... were higher than", "would rather be sleeping than"), when suggesting a limit ([no] more than), or in phrases where "than" presents the time before which something should occur/n't occur ("no earlier than").   It seems that this attention head is more focused on recognizing.

This head is active when  contains the phrase 'shortly after' or 'soon after', usually following a specific event or time marker. From the examples, it appears that the head does not activate for phrases such as 'immediately after', 'on or shortly after', 'just days after' or when 'after' is used in contexts like 'looking after', suggesting that it specifically looks for the aforementioned temporal expressions. The attention head, however, can be activated irrespective of what comes before 'shortly after' as evidenced by different structures including sentences, independent clauses, list items, direct speech and parenthesized text..

This head is active when  includes an expression where "or so" is used to estimate amounts of things such as time, people, or quantities. The attention head focuses on instances where "so" is used to indicate an approximation often following a numerical value.  For example, "a month or so" and "100 or so" both use "so" in this capacity.  When "so" is used as a conjunction to introduce a clause or as an adjective to emphasize an adjective or an adverb, as in the inactive examples like "the reason it took him so" and "this poisoning crisis had now spread far beyond just the heroin market ... for so", the attention head remains inactive..

The attention head seems to be specifically looking at instances where 'super.on' is present, likely when superclasses' methods are being called in Android programming.  As for the inactive examples, these texts lack any characteristics of Android programming methods, specifically the "super.on" pattern. Most of these texts contain everyday language or non-Android specific domain terminology. This could explain why the attention head does not activate on these texts, as it seems conditioned to be alerted by Android lifecycle methods..

This head is active when  contains a phrase or sentence structure that introduces an example or specific instance of something previously mentioned. Common phrases that activate this head include "for example", "such as", "take for example", or "see, for example". The purpose of these phrases is to provide a concrete illustration or instance that supports or elaborates on the point or concept just mentioned. Even when these phrases are embedded in different complex sentence structures, the attention head still becomes active. This suggests that it is particularly adept at identifying this specific stylistic feature of written language. In contrast, the attention head is inactive when there are no phrases that introduce an example or specific instance of a previously mentioned point or concept in the document..

This head is active when  contains a list of items or processes that follows a certain pattern or sequence that can continue indefinitely, often indicated by phrases indicating continuation such as "and so on". The head appears to predict the introduction of an additional item in a sequence, suggesting the "on" here refers to the continuation "on" in phrases like "and so on".  However, in cases where the documents are more code-based, or the context does not include an ongoing list or sequence, or where "on" is part of a method or function (such as "onCreate" or "onActivityCreated" in coding languages), this attention head is inactive.

This head is active when  suggests shared actions, tasks, intentions or experiences of a collective group, or indicates a recipient of a certain action or influence. It triggers when the context refers to something being done or given to "them", some kind of interaction or collective engagement with "them", or "them" being influenced or affected by something.   For the inactive examples, in the first one, "them" is used in the context of conversation or statement, not associated with a shared intention or action. In the second example, "them" is used to refer to two specific individuals and the context is a narrative about observing their actions, rather than an interaction or collective engagement with "them". So, the attention head is not triggered by these uses of "them"..

This head is active when  refers to a specific event or activity taking place "for the first time", or referred back to a certain "time" in the past in the context of a person's age or certain events transpiring, whereas it is inactive for generic references to time such as carrying out a task "one at a time", "this time", or when "at a time" is used to refer to doing something in installments or stages. The examples show that the head is sensitive to phrases or contexts that indicate a significant event occurring for the first time or a specific time marker introduced by "at the time" in history or someone's life..

This head is active when  contains quantitative or comparative phrases before the token "them", establishing a specific group or set of entities that "them" refers to. This includes phrases such as "many of them", "all of them", "most of them" and statements specifying a particular number or set of items immediately preceding "them", for example: "16 cases of the virus state-wide, all of them". The attention head seems to be triggered by the need to predict "them" in the context of referring to some subset of a previously mentioned group or set.  In the inactive examples, "them" is often preceded by negative statements (e.g., "is not one of them"), or phrasing where "them" refers back to a less well-defined group (e.g., "others like them"), or even when "them" is used in more complex grammatical structures ("is the end of the world as we know them"). This implies that the attention head does not activate when "them" is used in these.

This head is active when  includes a phrase that equates to "in doing so" or "doing so," as the phrases immediately preceding " so" in active examples contain a variant of "do". It seems the attention head is activated by the presence of a certain action being performed, hence the repeated "doing" in active cases.   In contrast, the attention head remains inactive when the phrase "do so" is used in more varied contexts, such as "to do so," "to promptly return them," or "encourage others to find solutions on their own", even when the phrase is followed by "and in doing so."   Moreover, it is inactive when "so" is not related to an act or is used to refer to an extent or degree, such as "more so" or "rightfully so"..

This head is active when  contains more specific narrative details or when the text is providing additional context or information about a specific event or situation. For example, in the active examples, the attention head is active in phrases that describe reports being released, certain actions being taken, or a specific setting or occurrence (e.g., a celebration, sentencing, or release of a product).   On the other hand, it is inactive when the text is of a more general nature, dealing with studies or reports without providing specific context or detailing a specific occurrence. Additionally, in most of the inactive examples, there's a lack of a specific action or change taking place, (e.g., predicates) compared to the active examples, where there's usually some form of action or change happening. In summary, it gets activated when additional context or narrative detail is introduced..

This head is active when  contains preciseness on an action or condition being done or set by a specific person, group or entity. Essentially, the text is structured in a way that involves a specific subject before the statement ending with " by". In the active examples, we see patterns such as "edited by", "written by", "produced by", "originally posted by", indicating a concrete action or condition set by someone.  On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when something is not specifically done or set by someone, or when the statement with " by" is in the middle of the sentence and not precisely connected to the subject before it. In the inactive examples, phrases such as "accompanied by", "headed up by", "aided and abetted by", do not point to a specific action or a condition set by the named subjects following these phrases, thus the attention head is less likely to be triggered.   Additionally, in the inactive examples, the statement with " by" is.

This head is active when  is building comparisons or contrasts between two or more different situations, subjects or elements. Each active sentence features a "while" as a conjunction, showing it's being used to introduce a contrast or additional point to the preceding text. However, in the inactive example, "while" is used as a conjunction, but it doesn't convey a strong contrast or an addition to the previous context. Instead, it primarily serves to continue the explanation of the facts stated earlier. So, this attention head seems to be particularly sensitive to the usage of "while" to outline a distinct contrast or comparison..

This head is active when  contains the phrase 'get along well' or 'fit well' with no prepositions such as 'in', 'on', 'for' etc. preceding or following the word 'well', or when the phrase 'know well' is used. The attention head does not activate when the structure is 'suits you well', 'knows full well', 'served the country well', or when a preposition like 'in' immediately follows 'well' as in 'fits in well' and 'works just well'. The attention head thus seems to be sensitive to the syntactic structure around the word "well"..

(9, 2151, 88), ' check', 0.8
This head is active when  contains a phrase or sentence that informs the reader about a certain topic or issue and then suggests or guides them to "check" for additional or detailed information. This may be in the form of directives, additional knowledge, suggestions, instructions, or guidelines.  For example, phrases such as "For further information check...", "To learn more about..., check", "For details..., check", or "If you're being criticized..., check". These phrases establish a context or background, and then direct the reader to "check" for more information or details.  The inactive examples do not follow this pattern. They simply use "check" as part of a suggestion to do something while waiting or after completing a certain task, without providing specific context, guide or direction to the reader..

(10, 1122, 103), ' way', 0.8
This head is active when  describes a process or action that is clearing a path or removing obstacles, often metaphorically. The attention head is most active when the phrase is directly associated with the act of 'paving' or 'clearing a path.' The key overarching context where the attention head is active appears to be an action has taken place to facilitate or enable something, rather than describing a route or journey which is in progress or completed which are the scenarios in which the attention head is inactive..

(10, 2408, 118), ' over', 0.8
This head is active when  contains comparisons, choices, or situations of conflict where one thing or entity is preferred, is victorious, or has an advantage over another. It is notable in examples of sports victories, comparisons of products or preferences, control context, or situations with the structure of gaining or having something "over" something else. The inactive examples, while also containing 'over', don't activate the model as they lack the preceding comparative or conflicting context. This attention head doesn't seem to operate based on isolated phrases, but requires specific contexts where 'over' indicates something held or gained in comparison to others..

(11, 967, 118), ' called', 0.8
This head is active when  describes the creation, establishment or introduction of something with a unique name, or the identification/mention of a unique entity, concept, or item with a specific name, prior to the token "called". It's also noticeable that in most active instances, the sentence often follows a certain pattern: "a thing/object/person with some context or background" followed by "called".  However, the attention head is not active when "called" is used in defining or renaming terms, explaining processes, or in structures such as "also called". The difference comes in the way "called" is used - in the active examples it's more about introducing or identifying something new, whereas in the inactive examples it's about definition, renaming, or additional information..

This head is active when  mentions a political or ideological direction, particularly in a context of associating a person, party, group or ideology with "far-right" or "ultra-right". It also seems to take note when "right" is used in the sense of a spatial direction (e.g., "turn right"). However, the head is inactive when "right" is used to refer to a body part or positioning, like "his right" referring to an individual’s right side or body part, when it refers to alignment in images (e.g., "float: right"), or meteorological descriptions (e.g., "top right"). Therefore, the attention head seems to focus on ideological or directional uses of the term "right", but not physical or descriptive uses..

This head is active when  discusses a concept, entity, or situation that has persisted or evolved from the past to the present day, often with phrases like "still exists today", "where he/it is today", or "as I am today". This could be referring to a variety of things - objects, practices, systems, places, or individuals. It is inactive in instances where the existence or status of something "today" is mentioned without a direct comparison or link to its past state or context..

(9, 5, 11), ' too', 0.7802197802197802
This head is active when  contains a comparison or parallel structure indicated by conjunctions like "as" or "so", with the "too" appearing at the end of the statement. It seems to fire in instances where one case or situation is similarly applicable to another (As X, so too X).   In the inactive examples, while "too" still appears, it isn't following the same parallel structure or doesn't come at the end of a comparison, but rather as part of the main clause. For instance, "That, friends, is what is known as having your cake and eating it too" or "[Obamacare], and that goes for the middle-income group as too".   The contrast between the active and inactive instances seems to rely on the structural arrangement and the function of "too" within the sentence. In the active cases, "too" is used to emphasize a parallel or comparison, but in the inactive ones, it's merely part of the main clause or in a different sentence structure..

This head is active when  indicates someone putting something into words or expressing a point of view, often using the structure "As [person's name/role] put it". In other words, the attention head is triggered when there is a translation or interpretation of someone's thoughts or ideas. In the inactive examples, this specific structure is not present, hence, the attention head is not necessary..

This head is active when  consists of coding syntax, specifically programming scripts for object-oriented programming (OOP), particularly in Java or similar languages. It seems to particularly trigger when encountering method declarations or invocations related to the lifecycle of certain programming objects, such as the 'onCreate' event in the Android framework (a lifecycle event triggered when creating a new activity).   However, the attention head seems inert when the document used natural language text or other forms of language text that didn't involve programming syntax. For instance, in the inactive examples, there are informal texts, guiding instructions, or discussions but none of them use OOP language syntax, as a result, this attention head doesn't get triggered..

This head is active when  contains a phrase that ends with " at" which contributes to the context or meaning in the sentence rather than simply indicating a location, time or an item in a list.   In the active examples, " at" follows a comprehensive description or statement which involves some sort of results, actions, or developments. For example, in the sentence "set up a research division looking at", " at" follows a description of an action taken by the Bank of England. Similarly, in the sentence "definitely accomplished more individual success at", " at" is used to end a summary of an individual's achievements. In these instances, " at" is part of the semantic structure of the sentence.  On the other hand, in the inactive examples, " at" is used more functionally, such as to introduce a location or time or to introduce a function or email in a list. For example, in the sentences "you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at" and.

This head is active when  contains a logical or consequential progression, often following an explanation, result or proposal, which will lead to a subsequent action or conclusion. This is usually marked by phrases like "it is proposed", "it is apparent", "there is a need" or "it would be desirable". After these phrases, "then" introduces the consequent action or conclusion. In inactive examples, although "then" is used, it typically does not follow such a logical or consequential progression and is often used to denote sequential actions or events instead of consequences or results..

This head is active when  seems to be comparing or contrasting two or more distinct ideas, situations, statistics, or subjects, usually in a more complex and nuanced manner. Often these comparisons involve percentages or statistics, diverse subjects, or involve a more explanatory or descriptive style of writing. The inactive examples tend to be simpler, less nuanced comparisons, often not involving statistics or elaborate contexts. While the inactive examples still have the "while" conjunction, the contexts do not expose a complex, analytical, or statistical comparison as in the active examples..

This head is active when  contains causality or a reason for certain action or behavior. It tends to trigger when the text is explaining the reasoning behind something. It often follows phrases such as "the reason", "only because", "not because", etc. In these cases, the word "because" is pivotal for giving context and meaning to the reasoning being provided.   In the inactive examples, "because" serves a similar function, however it does not necessarily seem to be associated with explicit reasoning or explanation, but rather with a part of information or observation. It's also seen to be inactive in mostly shorter phrases, and in one case, it's inactive when preceded by "it's" instead of "it is"..

(9, 1360, 88), ' they', 0.75
This head is active when  contains a description or explanation of a process, event, or condition, and uses "they" as a reference to the previous information. It seems to be particularly attentive to texts where "they" is used to continue a description or explain a consequence or result of previously mentioned concepts or subjects. For instance, this occurs in a variety of contexts, from describing steps in using code, to explaining sequence of events in a story, or detailing a particular aspect of an object or situation.  However, it's not clear why the attention head is inactive in some documents since no such examples are provided. The conditions under which it would be inactive could be better identified by providing documents that meet all other criteria, but do not trigger its activation..

This ownership is usually referring to an entity (an object, a concept, a group etc) that has a distinct quality, characteristic, obligation or responsibility. "Its" in this context is not simply a pronoun but carries the weight of indicating a defining feature or unique attribute of the entity it is associated with. In the inactive examples, "its" is still a possessive form but it frequently introduces an action that the entity is performing, rather than a possession or characteristic that belongs to it..

This can be highlighted by phrases such as "any of you Star Wars fans out there", "there are a countless number of innocent souls out there", and "obviously, there are single moms out there".   In other words, this attention head is employed to capture context when describing a nonspecific, generally understood population, or the presence of certain entities "out there".   On the other hand, in the inactive examples, the proposed "there" is either specific, as in the sentences "areas in Puget Sound specifically designated for protection because of the high number of endangered species that live there", or the sentences focus on specific events, people or conditions, instead of referring to an undefined mass audience or generalized entities, as in examples "are there really that many fans of the Bi-Beast out there", or "even if it means knocking loose a side view mirror here and there"..

This head is active when  contains a description of pride or praise in the context of the subject, typically organized groups or individuals, referring to themselves in the third person. It appears to be triggered specifically by the word "pride(s)" or "prided" or "recused" just before "themselves".   In the inactive examples, the word "themselves" is being used, but not in the same context. Often, it is part of a phrase suggesting an action or an expectation being carried out by the subjects themselves, rather than a reflexive use of 'pride' or 'recuse' indicating self-reference. In inactive examples, the phrase 'themselves' is devoid of any sentiment or actions that signify self-acclaim or self-isolation, which might be why the attention head remains inactive..

In contrast, when "only" is used elsewhere in the sentence as a qualifier or to describe a condition not necessarily related to exclusivity or restriction, like "can only join" or "only be visible to you", the attention head is inactive..

This head is active when  indicates a positive movement, decision, or action being done correctly or appropriately, often in a directional sense. The token "right" is used to affirm that something is proceeding or being carried out in a desirable or optimal manner.   For example, phrases like "moving in the right", "step in the right", "point me in the right", indicate a sense of directionality and progress which is viewed positively. Similarly, using "right" to describe doing something in its optimal or correct form, as in "doing exactly the right pose", "selecting the right", or "cooking...at the right", triggers the attention head.   However, it's inactive where 'right' is used to simply indicate time, as in "at the right time" or "doing something at the right time". Additionally, it's inactive when 'right' is used without a positive connotation, like "in the wrong place at the right", suggesting improper position regardless of the correct timing..

It tends to be associated with the words "laid", "wear", "kick", "set", "phase", "wipe", "powered", "fill" followed by "off". However, when "off" is used as part of phrases to indicate turning machines or lights on or off, shutting someone up, or referring to discarding or removing something (tearing, pick off, switching off) the attention head is inactive. It seems more inclined towards a transition or change rather than a simple cessation or initiation of an action.

This head is active when  contains expressions of personal preferences or requests. It detects sentences where the speaker or writer expresses a desire or wish for something or shows interest in some information or action. This is usually signified in the text by phrases such as 'I'd like', 'we'd like', 'you'd like', 'would like', etc. This attention head appears to respond to instances of direct speech where an individual or group is expressing their personal preferences or interests.   However, in the texts where the attention head is inactive, even though similar phrases are used, they do not trigger the attention head because the context does not denote personal preferences or requests. This suggests that the attention head is not solely looking for the specific phrases, but also the overall context in which they are used. For example, the phrase 'you'd like' in the sentence "about discounts and great offers from us, tick this box if you'd like" does not trigger the attention head probably because it's part of an impersonal and standard.

(9, 1985, 97), ' because', 0.7171717171717171
This head is active when  contains a clause that presents reasoning or justification expressed through the use of "because" in a contrasting or alternative scenario. It often comes after phrases involving negations such as "not because", "only because", or "mostly because". However, the attention head seems to become inactive when "because" is used to directly explain the reason behind a simple statement or action, typically following phrases such as "The reason...is because" or "If you wonder why...it's because"..

(9, 1308, 101), ' every', 0.7142857142857143
This head is active when  describes an ongoing or repeated action that happens on a regular basis, often regarding statistics, significant events, or routine behaviors. The specific frequency stated before the "every" often indicates this continuous or cycle-like nature. However, it is inactive when the documents are discussing specific actions with an indefinite frequency. It also seems to be inactive when the frequency is simply a set amount with no context or aspect of measurement or significance attached to it, such as in the examples "...on a every", "... a every", "...an almost every", and "...at a rate of 0.3% every". In these cases, the nature of the action is not identified as a periodic or ongoing cycle, but rather as a singular event or aspect with an attached frequency..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  museum, open to the public six days every
✅  for you 24 hours a day, 7 days every

(9, 5, 101), ' too', 0.7083333333333333
This head is active when  contains the word "too" in a context where it is used for emphasizing agreement or similarity with a prior statement, typically following a direct statement about something. For instance, in the phrase "I hope you do too", the "too" is emphasizing that the speaker hopes the listener also enjoys being part of something, agreeing with the speaker's prior sentiment.   In contrast, the attention head is inactive when the word "too" is used in contexts with phrases like "as well" or "as too", expressing the addition of something to a prior statement. Essentially, the head appears to be sensitive to differences in the way “too” is used in alignment/agreement versus addition/enumeration..

(10, 1122, 69), ' way', 0.7083333333333333
This head is active when  describes a complete or progressive action or process, often involved with a journey, movement, or transition. Phrases such as "came all the way", "under way", "find its way", and "made its way" suggest this, indicating an action, progression or journey that is either ongoing or completed. In the cases where the attention head is not active, most examples involve the phrase "the way" in a context where it is used to denote a path, challenges, or barrier, such as "in the way" and "pave the way", or it is used in an idiom/slogan sense like "come a long way", instead of denoting a progressive action or journey. Therefore, it seems the attention head is activated by phrases indicating dynamic progress or movement, rather than static path or hurdle..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  just as St Patrick's weekend gets under way
✅  west as South Dakota, through the northernmost reaches of the U.S. soybean-producing region, all the way

(11, 2069, 118), ' off', 0.7070707070707071
This head is active when  contains a phrase where "off" completes the action or state, often encapsulating the idea of removing, stopping, ending or switching off something.   For example, in the sentences "but Lando shut him off" and "after the light is switched off", the word "off" completes the idea of ending a process or turning off something. The action of "off" is typically immediate and direct, rather than part of a compound action or state like "laid-off" or "turn-off". The sentences where the head is inactive usually use "off" as part of compound verbs or phrases, where "off" does not independently express its typical meaning..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  could intervene to shut it off
✅ , but Mr. Trump repeatedly shut him off
✅  can deny it and shut it off
✅  households were merely a sticking plaster on demand and are likely to have the unintended consequence of shutting some first-home buyers off

(10, 1315, 23), ' down', 0.7
This head is active when  contains phrases that suggest "action" causing something to "down". The attention head seems particularly active in contexts where "down" implies a stoppage, reduction, end, or negative action (like shutting down processes, calming down from a state of agitation, gunning down,etc.) or a change in position (frowns upside down, placed upside down). It is not active when "down" is used in the context of decisions being handed down, or phrases that are more metaphorical like life being turned upside down or something boiling down to a point. Hence, it appears that attention head pays attention to more literal and tangible actions related to "down"..
Examples where the head is active:
✅  Crimea was gunned down
✅  center controlling breathing shuts down
✅  tell her to calm down
✅ orbitant operating and ticket costs forced the British-French airliner to shut down

(10, 1505, 11), ' then', 0.7
This head is active when  contains a sequence of events, steps, or reasons which lead to a conclusive action or statement, typically signified by the phrase "then". It often connotes a progression, cause and effect relationship, logical sequencing or process description, especially where the prior context establishes a premise or basis for the conclusion. The head is inactive where there are no such sequences or progressions to trigger the prediction of the token " then". Furthermore, it is important to note that in all of the active examples, "then" is used as an adverb to indicate a sequence, and not as a conjunctive to show a condition..

(10, 1453, 75), ' then', 0.696969696969697
This head is active when  contains an "if" conditional statement in which the condition specifically includes equals to/checks for equality operation or comparative expressions. For instance, using "==" or "=!" or "= $". Additionally, the input after the "if" often checks some object's attribute or status rather than only checking the existence or value of a single variable. The attention head also seems more active when the "if" statement appears after some other text or in more complex sentences rather than standing alone or at the start of a sentence. However, the attention head doesn't activate when the "if" check is related to a file or directory's existence or certain more specific programming contexts such as checking dimensions or existence of specific strings. It might not be activated when the input after "if" is represented in a mathematical notation..

This head is active when  contains a conditional statement or an exploratory question that begins with "if", followed by a condition, and is likely to be followed by "then". The condition can be a rule or a query that doesn't end with a punctuation mark. However, the attention head seems inactive when the conditional statements are more technical or coding language oriented that includes special characters like "[", "]", "=", "==" or ">=1". Essentially, the attention head is triggered when "if" is used in a more regular, conversational language context rather than in complex code language..

This head is active when  describes a series of actions or behaviors performed by a group or an entity referred to by a plural pronoun. The attention head is activated when the token "they" is going to be used to refer to a set of individuals, objects, or concepts previously mentioned in the text. In the active examples, phrases before 'they' often describe actions associated with a certain group or system. In the inactive examples, 'they' is used within more complex sentences where the reference may not be as clear cut or the context involves interruptions or comparisons, making it more complicated for the attention head to predict..

(9, 2209, 103), ' number', 0.6875
This head is active when  contains more contextual information before the phrase "there are a number" and "a number".   In the active examples, we see that the appearance of standalone sentences like "There are a number" is often surrounded or followed by other sentences, phrases, or contextual words or information that gives nuances to the document or sentence structure - for instance, *"In the literature there are a number"* or *"one of a growing number"*.   On the other hand, in the inactive examples, the sentence "There are a number" or similar phrases occur in isolation or start of the document, with less preceding context. This pattern shows that the attention head becomes active when there is additional context before the phrase that it is trying to predict. The additional context seems to provide the attention head more information, triggering it to be active..

This head is active when  contains the specific phrase "There are a number" at any point in the sentence or towards the end. It seems to be particularly sensitive to that exact wording, and doesn't activate for variations like "there are a good number", "In the literature there are a number" or "Although there are a number". Similarly, it doesn't activate when other phrases are used with 'number', like "He is among a number" or "quite a number". It seems to specifically require the phrase "There are a number" for activation..

(9, 1341, 103), ' well', 0.6875
This head is active when  contains the word "well" preceded by a qualifying term without a preposition before "well". In the inactive examples, "well" is usually associated with a preposition such as "in", "up", "on" or is followed by another word. Thus, the attention head is specifically looking for situations where "well" is used as an adverb qualifying the previous term, such as "fare well", "fits well", "works well" etc. It does not trigger in situations where "well" is part of a phrase or when the meaning of 'well' refers to fitting in or doing fine in a particular setting or context..

It appears to be more active when "way" is used to signify the concept of a process or journey, often in-progress or as something being made or prepared.  On the other hand, it is inactive when the document uses the word "way" in idioms or phrases that suggest a physical journey, path, or obstacle ("all the way", "pave the way", "in the way", "find its way", etc.), or when it is used in combination with actions implying force or effort to move or progress ("clawed their way", "force their way")..

This head is active when  contains phrases that express a desire, requirement, or instruction for 'like'. In many of the active examples, the token "like" is proceeded by a modal verb (would, could, etc), often expressing preference or instruction. Additionally, in most of the active samples the token 'like' is followed by an end of sentence or is at the end of a request or suggestion, giving it the context to predict 'like'.  In the inactive examples, 'like' is often used in a different context such as a comparison or as part of a phrase ('you might also like', 'what I like', 'doesn't like right', 'what you like or don't like'), rather than expressing a desire, requirement or instruction. Thus, the isolated use of 'like' rather in a phrase or particular context, tends not to activate the attention head..

This head is active when  suggests a differentiation or categorization amongst a group of things or people, typically by excluding or selecting a subset of them. This can be seen in active examples, often indicated by usage of phrases like "not one of them", "one of them", "among them", etc., which require the model to focus on a specific item or group within a larger set.  In contrast, the head is inactive when the document has more generic mentions of "them". It seems that in these inactive cases, the "them" does not differentiate or select from amongst a larger group in a specific way. Instead, the "them" often refers generally to a group of entities without specifically singling some out or categorizing them, as seen in phrases like "many of them", "almost all of them", "some of them" etc.   Hence the attention head seems to be sensitive to contexts where 'them' is used for differentiation rather than just a generic way of referring to a group..

This head is active when  contains a situation or narrative where one character is speaking to, interacting with or referring to a female character, often denoted by "her". The interaction seems to require direct communication or action towards the woman in the context. For instance, "he tells her", "followed her", "accused ... her" exhibit direct verbal or physical interaction towards the woman.   On contrast, in the documents where the attention head is inactive, most of the sentences refer to "her" in a more passive or indirect manner, often tied with the preposition "with". For instance, "brought with her", "bringing with her" do not show a direct interaction or reference to the woman, making the attention head inactive..

It is not active when the document refers to factors or aspects which are too specific ("other long-known risk factors"), overly generalized ("in a number of scientific areas") or when "such" is used after mentions of "other factors."

This head is active when  refers to something that was initiated, started, or took place in the specific month of March, often in reference to an organization, event, or people's actions. The documents with active attention head are mentioning details about events held, projects started, positions assumed, or registrations made in March. In other words, the phrase "in March" is often associated with the inception or occurrence of a specific action or event.  In contrast, the attention head is inactive when "March" is only used to indicate a time frame without additionally indicating the start or occurrence of a specific action or event. Phrases like "published March", "in March", "beginning March", and "on March" where there is no specific action tied with the stated timeframe are instances where the attention head remains inactive. In these instances, the phrase "in March" is mostly used to inform about the time or duration, rather than highlighting the inception or happening of an event..

This head is active when  contains a sentence that requires the word "same" to complete a concept or idea and doesn't already contain the word "same" before. In all active examples, the sentences are cut off before the term that "same" is modifying (e.g. "same-sex marriage," "legalize same," etc.), meaning the next token prediction needs to be "same" to make grammatical and contextual sense.   In contrast, in all inactive examples, the term that "same" is modifying is already complete (e.g. "same-sex couples," "bans same-sex marriage," etc.), or "same" is not contextually or grammatically correct as the next token. In some inactive cases, "same" is used but not as part of a phrase or term (e.g. "no longer same").   Thus this attention head is focusing on predicting the use of "same" as a modifier in a term or concept, and its activation is dependent on context that indicates such a.

This head is active when  discusses topics or entities related to sexual orientation or marriage equality, particularly concerning gay, lesbian or same-sex relationships or laws. The attention head seems to be triggered when the discourse is about the status, recognition or legislation of such relationships, often as a part of a debate, discussion or report.  In the inactive examples, the topic is still related to the same-sex issues but is often focused on the legal aspect, individuals who happened to be gay, or referred to as part of a broader discussion without directly indicating the condition or status of same-sex relationships. Moreover, words like "legal", "legalize" and "law" do not seem to activate the head, neither does mentioning LGBTQ in an abstract historical context. This could possibly be due to the attention head focusing on more personal or direct references to same-sex relationships, rather than broad legal or social discussions..

This head is active when  contains a list or enumeration of items, groups, individuals or elements, with "them" referring to these enumerated items. The head appears to be looking for instances where "them" is used to indicate a collective set of something - it could be people, items, reasons, methods, etc. This could also include instances where a count or quantifier is used before "them" like "many of them", "most of them", etc. However, the attention head is inactive when "them" does not clearly refer back to a previously mentioned, quantifiable group, or if "them" is part of a decreased emphasis on the exact number or quantity in the sentence..

This head is active when  features comparative statements or assessments, often formulated as questions or hypotheses. Particularly, it seems to be looking for phrases that start with "What better" or "more ... than", indicating some form of comparison or judgement. It's also activated when there's comparison between two subjects (e.g. "males than females"), or two groups (e.g. "treatment group than in the control group"). Other examples include comparisons regarding the effectiveness or value of one aspect over another. It is not activated in documents that use "than" in purely numerical comparisons (e.g., "higher than"), descriptions without evaluation, or cases where "than" only serves to connect phrases without containing any judgement or comparison to a standard..

This head is active when  includes a phrase where the word "only" limits or sets conditions. This usually happens in contexts where "only" defines terms or limitations, such as in legal texts, instructions, or descriptive phrases. These indicate either exclusivity or specific conditions. The active documents involve the term "only" used for describing terms and conditions or for stating exclusivity.   However, when the term "only" simply serves to restrict an action, quantifies an entity, or is part of idioms like "if and only", the attention head becomes inactive.

This head is active when  suggests an action or a recommendation that is not directly prefaced by or coupled with a phrase leading to further information or inquiry. This can be seen where the word "check" is used right after the motivation or reason to do an action. For example, "While you're in Chinatown, check...", or "To learn more about..., check.".   In contrast, it is inactive when the phrase preceding "check" alludes to a request or requirement for further information, or when "check" is associated with a direct command or instruction.

This head is active when  discusses some form of preference, evaluation, or comparison with the concept of "over" signifying dominance or superiority. This can be observed in expressions like "a better toy than the Headmasters", "take precedence over", "prioritizes the neoliberal global order over", "distinct advantage over" etc., where one idea, action or entity is preferred, chosen or prioritized over another.   On the contrary, when "over" is used in the context of scores in sports or victories, such as "3-1 friendly victory over" or "48-45 victory over", it isn't active. Similarly, when "over" is used to denote authority or decision-making power, as in "complete control over", "presides over", or "handed over", this attention head isn’t active either. Thus, it seems to focus specifically on contexts of comparison, preference or evaluation..

It could mean literally shutting something down (such as a process or machine), turning something upside down (indicating a reversal or negative situation), calming down (a reduction in intensity), or a decision being handed down (reflecting the conclusion of a process). The head is inactive when "down" is used in a spatial or directional context rather than implying a change in status or condition, such as tracking something down..

This head is active when  is expressing frequency or rate with a structure that includes a numerical value directly followed by the term "every". This numerical quantity can be a number like 1, 2, 60 etc. or a percentage like 0.3% or 2%. It also seems to be looking for a specific structure where "every" is used to express recurring intervals like "once every", "7 days every", or "0.3% every".   In the inactive examples, despite containing the term "every", the attention head isn't triggered because either the term "every" isn't directly preceded by a numerical value or the numerical value doesn't directly follow the specific structures that the attention head is looking for. For instance, phrases such as "on a every", "a every", "an almost every" do not match the specific structure the attention head is looking for, hence it remains inactive..

This head is active when  is referring to a wide or flexible range of something, expressing a concept of universality. The key phrases are usually "just about any", "pretty much any", "almost any" and "nearly any", indicating that the subject can be relevant or applied to virtually any context, situation, object or person. These phrases often indicate broad applicability or flexibility.   In contrast, when the phrases above are absent or when the context does not indicate a concept of universality, like in phrases "more than any" or "unlike any" indicating uniqueness or exceptionality, or when a comparison is being made, the attention head is likely to be inactive..

This head is active when  ends with a question or phrase that naturally leads to a question, and that question starts with "does". However, in the inactive cases, although some documents do end with "does", the attention head is not active because the expected/next token is not merely " does" on its own. In most inactive examples, additional words or conditions are attached with "does" such as "or does", "then does", "not only does", and "nor does", which make the statement more complex and do not fit the pattern of a simple question starting with "does".

This head is active when  contains instances of advice, instructions, or suggestions directed towards the reader or a person being spoken about. This often coincides with the use of phrases that are guiding the reader to do something or make a choice, such as "follow it until you", "your choices to help you", "work hard to get where you", or "imagine how you’d get drenched in sweat when you". In contrast, it seems to be inactive in instances where the phrase "you" is used in recounting actions or events as in the inactive examples..

This head is active when  mentions something or someone existing or being "out there", which implies a group or a large, undefined area. The phrase "out there" tends to appear when referring to a general or undefined population, whether it's indicating people, resources, options, etc. However, it doesn't activate when "there" is used in specific, definite locations like "here or there" or "that live there", where the context is precise and localized..

This head is active when  seems to be listing or enumerating something. That is, the attention head gets activated when the next token is "such" following descriptions, attributes, or examples, signalling the initiation of a series or list.   Also, it appears that the head is activated when the next word or phrase after "such" may provide more specific examples or further details pertaining to the discussed subject. This is often indicated by phrases like "such as", "such as these", or "such as the", followed by the specific details or examples. In contrast, inactive examples do not show this pattern. Besides, some of those inactive examples lead to phrases like "such a" or "such… that", which don't align with the pattern observed in active instances..

This head is active when  indicates a prospective or future action concerning making something work, a trial to make something work, or questions about a working functionality. It seems to be sensitive to expressions that encompass uncertainty about whether something will work or about methods to make something work.   In contrast, it is inactive where there's a clear failure or a definitive past instance of something not working. The inactive examples consistently indicate actions or efforts that have already been attempted and have resulted in failure (didn't work, wouldn't work, does not work, etc.), as opposed to the 'active' examples which lean towards a more forward-looking context..

This head is active when  contains the phrase "way" in the context of indicating a direction, path, or journey (either actual or metaphorical). It seems to be particularly attuned to scenarios where someone or something has moved, traveled, or changed position. Additionally, it often appears to be active when "way" is used at the end of the sentence or phrase. However, when the "way" is used for expressions implying making possibilities or creating opportunity such as "pave the way", "making way", this attention head is inactive..

(9, 1308, 100), ' every', 0.6208791208791209
This head is active when  mentions a consistent, repeated action or event but does not specify the frequency (in terms of 'once', 'twice', etc) at which this action or event occurs. The attention head is seemingly bridging this gap of information by predicting "every" as the next token. This anticipation of "every" prepares for the introduction of a time frequency (e.g., 'every year', 'every day') to quantify the repeated action or event.   For the inactive cases, the attention head is not activated because most of these sentences already have frequency words like 'once' and 'a few times' before needing to predict "every". In these scenarios, the input already provides the repetition frequency, so there is no need for the model to predict the word "every"..

This head is active when  features a comparison or a degree of something being more or less than others or nearly everything. It tends to be activated by phrases like "more than any", "almost any", "unlike any" etc. These phrases imply a sense of scale or comparison. In the inactive examples, there isn't that same extent of comparison. Instead, the phrases such as "compatible with almost any", "fits almost any" or "enjoyed by pretty much any" present a general applicability or compatibility, not a comparison. Also, it seems the head is more often active when the word "any" appears towards the end of the sentence or phrase..

This usually has a structure of a subject followed by an action, most commonly ending in "to find out" or "points out", or describing an action "carried out". However, it seems to get inactive when the tone of the narrative is informal, casual or context involves reflexive understanding or self-operations happening naturally or as a turn of events often showing the structure "turns out".

This head is active when  contains the word "only" that helps to illustrate, limit, or define the context of the information preceding it, often used to express a condition, restriction or stipulation. In other words, it is activated when "only" is used to highlight an exclusive circumstance or requirement, making the context specific or restrictive.  For example, in the sentence "Exercise can only work if you are following a proper diet" or "Team members can only join folders shared by teammates", the word "only" is being used to provide a specific condition, in both sentences indicating that there’s a single way or condition in which the activity (exercise or joining shared folders) will work.  In contrast, the attention head is inactive when "only" is used more idiomatically or figuratively, or when it is part of a fixed phrase such as "if and only" or "for one night only" or as part of an abbreviation like "Republican In Name Only".

It's more likely to be active when phrases such as "many of", "some of", "all of", "one of", "most of" precede "them", indicating a selective or inclusive relationship with a previously-mentioned group. These phrases suggest some proportion or categorization of the mentioned group is being discussed.   On the other hand, the head appears to be inactive if the relationship with the group isn't directly connected to proportion or categorization (for instance, "and others like them", "and have begun to use them", "as we know them", "how to use them" etc.) or when "them" is used within more complex sentences where the focus is not strongly on referring back to a subset of a specific group..

It is interested in the metaphorical uses of 'way' implying proceeding, preparing or facilitating.  For instance, "paving the way", which indicates making it easier for something to happen, as seen in "his resignation and paving the way" or "Committee and could pave the way".   It may also be attentive to phrases implying progression or reach through a course/area, like "all the way" as in "area now stretching all the way".  However, it is not interested when 'way' is used to denote a journey or path traveled (e.g. "come a long way", "trailed him all the way"), indicate spatial direction (e.g. "make its way") or refer to a process that's currently taking place (e.g. "investigation was under way")..

This head is active when  refers to personal preference or desire, or when offering an option or opportunity to the reader. The attention head seems to be triggered by variations of "I would like" or "you'd like", indicating its role in identifying inclinations or wishes. The sentence structures where it activates often describes a preference or an invitation to provide feedback.  The attention head is not active in instances where the context surrounding "like" does not denote preference or a possible action from the reader but just states the likability, for instance, "as much as you like". It also does not activate when "like" is used to introduce a comparative term ("doesn't like right") or when "like" is part of a larger negative context (“won't let you take away my right to eat what I like”, “don’t like”). In other words, it doesn't activate when "like" is part of a neutral or negative sentiment or comparison..

This head is active when  is making comparisons. It's specifically catching instances where the 'than' token is used to compare two things in some way, be it quantities, preferences, certain characteristics, or other differentiating qualities. This could be size comparisons (bigger/smaller), preference comparisons (would rather be... than), or other types of comparative statements. However, in all the active examples, 'than' is used at the end to introduce the second part of the comparison.  In the inactive examples, 'than' is also used to compare, but in these cases, 'than' does not close off a comparison statement and is rather used in a 'from... to...' structure or as an addition. These are more enumerative uses of 'than' and do not mark the end of comparison, which might be why the head is inactive in those examples..

(9, 1047, 88), ' does', 0.5656565656565656
This head is active when  contains a phrase that is a question or appears to question something, often ended with "Or does". The phrase typically comes after a statement or proposition, suggesting the attention head is looking for a certain form of questioning or counter-argument pattern within the text.   In contrast, the inactive examples do not contain this questioning pattern. Although many of them contain questions, they are not structured in a way that contrasts two potential realities or propositions - there is little sense of a counter-proposition being posed. Thus, the usage of "does" in the inactive examples is typically in a straightforward question or declarative sentence, not in a contrastive inquiry, which is what seems to trigger this particular attention head..

This head is active when  makes a generalized statement or refers to a collective group that's not specified, often using phrases like "there are", "out there", or "there may be". In these instances, "there" seems to be used in a way that refers to the wider world or a larger, unspecified group of people, places, or things. Conversely, the attention head is inactive when the "out there" phrase is used in specific contexts or when referring to defined groups or events, as seen in the inactive examples..

This head is active when  contains a clause or phrase that needs to complete a future action or directive, often denoted by "to do so" or "in doing so." In most cases, it also follows a comma and is part of the sentence that completes the action stated or implies an action that will be done in the future.   In the inactive instances, the usage of "so" is often part of a continuous phrase or clause such as "doing so" or "more so," rather than needing to complete an action. Additionally, in some inactive examples, "do so" exists but it is not used as a directive or does not signify an action that will be completed in the future..

This head is active when  contains phrases related to growth or progression, such as "grew up," "end up," or "made up". It appears to focus on words that signify a process, transition or conclusion from one phase to another. For inactive examples, the attention head doesn't seem to be activated by the term "end up" framed within potentially negative or neutral contexts. The active examples all show the term "up" used within a positive or neutral context, often related to growth and progression..

This head is active when  contains a question, especially in cases where the question is asked after a brief or detailed explanation of a situation or subject. It seems to be activated when context is provided and the expected token "does" is part of a follow-up question or inquiry. In the inactive examples, although many contain the token "does", they don't usually follow the pattern of an explanation or context followed by a question. In many of the inactive cases, the "does" is also part of a question, but it often comes after the negation ("not" or "nor") or a presumed choice ("or does"), thus not triggering the attention head..

(10, 3032, 55), ' it', 0.5595238095238095
This head is active when  features an incomplete phrase or thought that needs to be completed with " it". The phrases often lead up to a point or conclusion and "it" serves as a bridge to provide that information. In other words, this head appears to activate when the narrative is constructed in such a way that "it" can be used to refer back to a previously mentioned or implied concept, idea, or situation.   This is not the case in the inactive examples, where "it" is often used in quotations or as part of complete expressions where its reference is already clear within the same sentence, such as "put it" in "As Martin Stuchtey of McKinsey put it." Thus in these instances, the attention head does not need to predict "it" as the token is already contextually complete..

This head is active when  suggests or implies a correct action, direction, or choice, and when the word "right" plays a part in phrases like "in the right", "at the right" or "the right". It appears to trigger when the term "right" is used in the context of correctness or appropriateness, rather than as a directional descriptor or a rights-related term. Conversely, it appears to be inactive when "right" is paired with prepositions like "at" or "in", as in "at the right" or "in the right", or when "right" is part of a larger term, like "in its own right" or "the right combination"..

(9, 1616, 103), ' each', 0.5505050505050505
This head is active when  includes two or more entities or subjects that engage in a reciprocal or mutual interaction. It commonly triggers when words suggesting interaction or alignment, such as "interact", "face", "line up", "talk", "move radially" etc., precede the token "each each". Moreover, it also seems to be more active when there's clear separation or distinction between entities or subjects, as evidenced by phrases like "first and second diodes", "opposition and Syrian government", "clamping pawl and slide block".  In the inactive examples, the phrases typically involve parallel, similar, or one-sided actions rather than reciprocal ones. For instance, phrases like "are opposite", "complement", "hugged", "encourage", "laid out apart", "arguing", occur concurrent to or against each other rather than a reciprocal exchange or interaction. Hence, they fail to trigger the attention head..

This head is active when  is discussing or questioning if certain actions, methods, items or strategies will work or not. This head seems more related to finding instances where attempts or suggestions towards a solution, particularly in technical and programming contexts, are being made - often, when a previous approach has been unsuccessful. It is triggered by phrases indicating attempts and uncertainty like "I tried", "seems to work", "might not work", "didn't work" and so on. The key point is that the activity of the attention head is not determined by the certainty of whether something will work or not, but more so the discussion or question of its functionality. Meanwhile in inactive cases, the context often involves suggestions or phrases that seem definitive or certain about something working..

(11, 1846, 9), ' this', 0.5416666666666667
This head is active when  refers to an event or action that took place, typically past tense, directly followed by "this". The attention head associates "this" with the presentation of new findings (like a study or a report being released), a celebration or marking of a milestone, a guilty plea, an announcement, sentencing of a defendant, etc. The key element seems to be the immediacy of the action, meaning that the event just happened and it's directly linked to "this".  On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when "this" is placed at the end of the sentence without a direct, immediate action preceding it in the same sentence. In the inactive examples, "this" is generally being used to refer to a larger scale of time (such as a season or a year), future actions, or is part of a dependent clause within a longer sentence..

This head is active when  mentions interaction, opposition, movement or relationship between two entities. Specifically, it triggers when the entities are in some sort of conflict, dynamic interaction, or reciprocal relationship, such as arguing, teasing, blaming, complimenting, trash talking, being attracted or being in a cognitive mismatch. However, when the relationship is passive or non-dynamic as in simply being next to each other, or unknown to each other, the attention head does not activate..

This head is active when  suggests an action or process progressing or aiming towards correctness, appropriateness or a desired direction - specifically when the token "right" is used in the context of aiming towards an ideal or correct situation or condition. However, it seems to be inactive when the token "right" is used more literally or spatially, such as referring to a direction or location, or in repeated/prolonged phrases in which 'right' appears multiple times. Moreover, it also tends to be inactive when 'right' appears in interrogative sentences or requests for guidance..

This head is active when  mentions a simple sentence that ends with a historical date, event, or duration that occurred in the month of March. It especially picks up on instances when something important started, ended, or was due to occur in March—whether this is the start or end of a deployment, the launch of a product, a significant death, a meeting, or an anniversary. The attention head doesn't activate for instances where "in March" is embedded within a longer complex sentence or phrase, as seen in the inactive example..

However, it does not become active when " well" is used in phrases like "get along well", "fits well", or "works well" which indicate a harmonious, suitable, or functioning relationship or condition. The attention head also does not seem to be active when " well" is used in a context where it is followed by another adverb such as "too well" or "just well". The attention head specifically seems to look for situations where 'well' is used to convey the concept of suitability, fitting in, or doing alright, without any accompanying context of harmony or a furtherqualifier..

This head is active when  includes a possessive "your" that is preceded by a pronoun ("you", "they", etc.) or noun referring to a person or group of people ("clients", "counselor", "character", "dealer", etc.). In these cases, the attention head seems to be trying to capture the idea of personal belonging or suited preferences. However, it becomes inactive when "your" is used without such a clear reference to personal belonging, is used incorrectly/inappropriately, or after a clause that does not have a clear subject..

This head is active when  is referring to rankings, peak positions in charts or lists or patent references. It becomes active when the text talks about a specific position (especially in music charts) or a specific patent identifier. However, it is inactive when simply mentioning a number without these specific contexts, such as a phone number, IBAN number, or in generalized mentions like "number one" in non-specific contexts. The attention head is more inclined towards recognising specific contexts where a follow up "number" mention is critical to understand the text, such as peak chart positions or patent numbers..

This head is active when  mentions political ideologies or physical directions positioned on the right. It often comes into play for documents that talk about far-right or center-right political parties, ideologies, or figures. It's also active when referring to physical directions or body parts that are on the 'right' side. Conversely, it tends to be inactive in documents that talk about directions or body parts on the 'left' or 'center' or where 'right' is not clearly associated with a political ideology or a physical direction..

This head is active when  contains phrases or structures that indicate a goal, instruction, or desired change is being outlined or described, often boiled down to a process or activity. These often include "how to…" structures, "in order to," or sentences where something is proposed and subsequently described on how to achieve or execute it. The focus is on the intention to accomplish or achieve something, and thus the next token being "that" points to the previously mentioned goal. Examples such as "the best way to accomplish that," "in order to do that," and "how to do that" exemplify this pattern.   In contrast, the attention head seems to be inactive in documents where "that" is used in more casual, idiomatic expressions often referring to something already mentioned or known, like "stuff like that," "something like that," or where it's used in an interjecting phrase such as “having said that,” or when “that” is used to refer to a known concept or object, like “.

This head is active when  refers to "state" as a condition or status, particularly relating to the state of things such as projects, entities, or circumstances. It seems to be most clearly activated when there are descriptions of changes or current observations about the state of something. However, it doesn't seem to activate as consistently with descriptions relating to physiological or biological states, such as "coma-like state," "hydrated state," or "retracted state." Additionally, phrases like "in its current state" seems to activate the attention head in certain contexts but not others, suggesting specific contextual factors in addition to the general usage of "state" may influence this attention head's activity..

This head is active when  includes a phrase or term being defined or rephrased, particularly when the term is embedded within a contextual sentence. However, it seems to be inactive when the term being defined forms a part of an official title, or in a monotone legal language document or when it refers to an organization or team. So, it primarily looks for instances where a term is redefined or simplified for layman's understanding within the descriptive context (informal setting) and deactivates when the term is an explicit and formal part of the information (formal setting)..

This head is active when  refers to the subject in the second person ("you") and seems to be directing a statement, instructions or expressing personal comments or thoughts towards the reader or the character being referred to. The attention head recognizes "your" as a possessive adjective, indicating something belonging to or associated with the person it is addressing. It seems particularly likely to be sensitive to structures where "your" is the last part before a break, such as the end of a sentence, or before a section with different context. It also seems to be active in cases where 'your' is set to represent possession or a direct relationship with the topic being discussed. In the inactive instances, the context is less personal and direct, often describing options available to a general audience, not specifically engaging the reader. The usage of 'your' in the inactive examples is more related to a choice or a variable factor rather than a direct dialogue or discussion..

This head is active when  contains phrases like "doing so", "to do so" or "do so" and these phrases are not embedded within a larger or complex sentence. It seems to focus when these phrases are central to the sentence meaning or part of a simple sentence structure.

For instance, in longer sentences where "doing so" or "to do so" are just a part of the sentence, the head is inactive..

This head is active when  is referring to a specific state related to a scientific, biological, or mechanical process or phenomenon. It seems to be activated when the context involves a detailed or nuanced discussion of a certain status affecting a non-human entity like a machine, enzyme, cellular population or astronomical bodies. Conversely, it stays inactive when the 'state' in discussion refers to a more conventional or general situation, particularly related to humans, animals, or relatively simple physical conditions. Examples of inactive contexts are when state refers to physical or emotional condition of humans or animals, or a simpler physical status of objects, and usage of 'state' in a broader economic or societal discussion..

This head is active when  contains a list of examples or comparisons in a certain context, especially referring to people, organizations, product brands, or forms of media. In all the active scenarios, the term "like" is used to introduce such examples. It seems to play a role in recognizing the potential sequence where it anticipates a noun or a phrase following the "like" to complete the analogical or comparative context.

Moreover, it's often triggered when there is a need to predict the use of "her" in a subsequent clause within the sentence, often involving indirect speech or matters of cognition involving the female character in question.   However, in the inactive examples, there seems to be complex sentence structures implicating multiple entities (human and non-human) or multiple actions involving the female character.

This head is active when  consists of sentences where the term "each" is repeated twice in succession or where there is clear indication of repetitive action, contact or interaction between two entities. For example, "interact with each each", "watch them both play, tease each each", "people began arguing with each each" and so on. It appears that the presence of two consecutive "each" terms or implications of parallel or repeating events between entities, triggers the activation of this attention head.  On the other hand, the attention head is inactive for documents where "each" is not repeated, or where there isn't a clear sense of repetitive action or interaction between two entities. For example, "the two definitions seem to clobber each each", "i would also like to find a like-minded male where we can participate in activities together and encourage each each", and so on. These instances either use "each" only once or use it twice but without a clear implication of repetitive interaction between entities..

This head is active when  contains the phrase 'do just that', 'how to do that', 'to do that', 'to accomplish that' and 'something like that', 'other than that', 'much smaller than that', 'nothing wrong with that' immediately preceding the token " that". It seems to be activated when discussion revolves around a specific idea or action and it is referred to using "that". It is not active when these exact phrases do not appear, even if the token "that" appears elsewhere in the document. Furthermore, it's inactive when "that" is used in phrases such as 'stuff like that', 'things like that', 'anything like that', 'more on that' or 'having said that'..

(9, 1341, 92), ' well', 0.5
This head is active when  contains the future token "well" preceded by a verb. This is most apparent when the "well" is part of a phrase that describes a function or action behaving or fitting "well." However, the attention head is not triggered when "well" is used in terms of knowing something or someone "well," or getting along "well." Hence, it suggests the attention head is focusing on the usage of "well" in a certain context, which is mostly related to actions or functions performing "well.".

This head is active when  contains comparative words or phrases such as "just about any", "pretty much any", "almost any", "more than any", "nearly any", "unlike any", etc. These phrases denote comparisons or contrasts, suggesting that the subject at hand is broader or more inclusive than typically expected, is different from others, or surpasses others in some aspect. Usually, these statements lead to "any", where it hints that the previous context applies to any person, thing, or situation. The attention head is inactive in the absence of any text, as it does not have any context to work with..

(10, 2093, 111), ' themselves', 0.5
This head is active when  refers to someone who is not specified or named directly. In all active instances, the term "themselves" is preceded by generic, non-specific pronouns or terms such as "or", "to", "who", "agent", "it" or "people". In contrast, in inactive examples, "themselves" is used after specific terms, people, entities or nouns such as "Firm", "(the) old elite", "Technologies", "He", "Hockey", and "They". Thus, this attention head seems to activate when the "themselves" refers to an undefined, unnamed or ambiguous entity in the text..

(11, 1605, 101), ' about', 0.5
This head is active when  is discussing a count, proportion, or measurement that is significant to the context of the sentence. However, it is not just the presence of these elements that activates the attention head, but rather their relation to a previous or upcoming qualitative or quantitative detail. In active examples, the token "about" often comes after numbers, measurements, or proportions that help qualify or quantify a prior mentioned subject matter.   On the other hand, the attention head is inactive in situations where "about" is used primarily to provide an approximate duration rather than an estimate or proportion that holds significant importance in the context of the document. For example, in the inactive examples, "about" is used to give a rough estimate of time or number that does not necessarily need further interpretation or understanding..

(11, 948, 11), ' right', 0.5
This head is active when  talks about the current state or a future state. It primarily triggers when there is an emphasis on the "present" or "future" aspects of the described situation. A common feature in all active examples is the usage of the phrase "right right", or "from right", which might indicate a repetitive or impending condition. However, this attention head is inactive when, despite using "right", the sentence is actually describing a past situation or a speculative scenario, such as prediction or a hope for future, rather than a sure future state. In essence, this attention head seems to focus on verifying or affirming the current or future state of affairs..

This head is active when  mentions an aspect of future prediction or anticipates an action or event in the future.   In the active examples, you can see phrases like "years from right", "a year from right", and assuming 'right' translates to 'now', it denotes future actions or events. Phrases like "we believe" and "will translate to" also denote predictions for the future.  In the inactive examples, the documents primarily discuss the present state, include direct commands, or observations in the current scenario evidenced by phrases like "we're sitting right right", "playing right now", "are experiencing bad weather right right" and "where we're at right". These documents do not make predictions or estimates about the future, contributing to the inactivity of the attention head..

(11, 2069, 100), ' off', 0.5
This head is active when  refers to the act of terminating or ending a process, often an action performed by a subject, that leads to a state of inactivity or unavailability. It highlights scenarios where an item or person is said to be turned off, shut off or laid off. Exceptions can also be found, like in "To top it off" and "phase off".  The attention head is inactive in situations where 'off' is associated with initiating actions (setting off, kicked off), turning off equipment without indicating who or what is doing the action (powering off, switched off), or removing or extinguishing elements (wiped off). It's also inactive in cases of incomplete sentences or phrases without clear context (not filled off)..

This head is active when  is suggesting or proposing something for the reader to consider or take action on. The active examples contain phrases like "I would like", "you would like", "If you'd like", all of which seem to involve a clear proposal being made. On the other hand, instances when "like" is used primarily to express preference without a call to action, such as "I'd really like" or "you'd like", don't seem to trigger this attention head..

This head is active when  contains conditional statements often starting with the word 'if'. This usually appears before an action or consequence that is then expressed after the 'then' clause. It seems to be present across multiple programming languages-- including shell, Lua, and Python-- and also in natural English language sentences incorporating conditional expressions. The absence of this sort of conditional structure in a document leads to the attention head being inactive..

This head is active when  contains a frequency or periodic occurrence indicating the repetition of an event or action. More specifically, the attention head is triggered by the pattern of expressing the frequency starting with "once" or "on a" and ending with "every". It does not activate when the phrase "once every" doesn't directly follow the frequency or temporal pattern. For instance, the inactive examples include more complex sentence structures, or those that include numeric values, measurements, and percentages just before "every"..

This head is active when  contains the word "off" used as a standalone preposition or phrasal verb, not as a part of hyphenated adjectives or compound words. It focuses on identifying overall usage of "off" in various contexts: to convey the stopping/termination of something (turn off, switched off, powered off, set off), the beginning of an event or action (kicked off), the completion or exhaustion of something (wear off, wiped off) and other similar variations. It seems to be inactive when "off" is used as part of compound words or hyphenated phrases that alter the meaning (i.e., worn-off, kick-off, shut him off, turn-on). Also, it seems to be inactive when "off" is used with hyphen separating the activities such as in kick-off, grayed-off, laid-off, etc..

This head is active when  is building up to a specific event or occurrence that is expected to happen or had already taken place on a certain date. Most of these instances involve a significant event or an official statement being declared at a certain time.   This attention head seems to be particularly interested in understanding temporal contexts expressed with 'on'. This includes everything from official pronouncements or events occurring on specific dates to legislative acts signed into law on certain days.

This head is active when  includes phrases or idioms that end with 'that', such as 'more on that', 'do just that', 'like that', 'something like that', 'stuff like that'. It anticipates the use of 'that' as a pronoun referring back to a previously mentioned concept or idea. It tends not to activate when 'that' is used more formally as a conjunction or relative pronoun connecting clauses or specifying a noun. In the inactive examples, 'that' is used in ways like 'accomplish that', 'do just that', 'smaller than that', which performs more complex grammatical roles in the sentence..

(9, 202, 55), ' that', 0.4583333333333333
This head is active when  ends with phrases such as "like that", "just that", or "do just that". The recurrent pattern in active cases is the ending phrase where the trailing word before "that" tends to be "like", "just", or "do". In the inactive cases, these patterns are not observed, the phrase "that" is used in a different context or the sentence doesn't end with "that"..

This head is active when  uses the phrase "doing so" or "to do so" to refer back to a previously mentioned action, or the phrase "rightfully so" to indicate agreement or approval of a previous statement. The attention head seems to recognize continuity and agreement in the documents. In the inactive examples, the phrases "doing so" and "to do so" also appear, but they either don't refer back to a previously stated action, or they are part of a longer, more complex sentence structure that may confuse the attention head function..

This head is active when  indicates an action or decision-making process, often followed by the mention of specific reasons or consequences related to the action. This is often indicated by phrases involving decision verbs such as "decided", "failed", "desired", "asked", "obligated", and negative constructions such as "declined". In these cases, the attention head predicts the following "so" as it relates to the reasoning or outcome of the aforementioned actions.  In the inactive examples, many sentences also contain the word "so", but it is used in a more general sense rather than to spotlight a particular decision or outcome. In some instances "so" is used to continue an argument or explanation, in others it is a part of expressions like "rightfully so" or "more so", and in some cases it does not represent a direct outcome of a specific action but a necessary action ("required to do so"). In these cases, the specific behavior that activates this attention head is absent..

(11, 907, 101), ' you', 0.45054945054945056
This head is active when  contains expressions, instructions, or suggestions that denote some form of flexibility, freedom, or personal decision-making. This is indicated by phrases like "as much as you," "any as you," "Until you," and "where you." These phrases hint towards the reader having an active role or a choice to make, usually defined by their comfort, speed, willingness, or preference.  However, the head is inactive when the statements are more assertive or fact-based, have a specific set of instructions without indicating any flexibility or freedom for choice, or when "you" is used in a context that is more about 'state of being' rather than 'doing' or 'choice-making'. For example, in the inactive cases, we see phrases like "led you to where you," "you can dump," or "Florida, go vote today" which are primarily declarative, instructional, or factual - leaving no room for personal discretion or flexibility..

(11, 2046, 108), ' made', 0.4473684210526316
This head is active when  is reporting on decisions or attempts, typically in the past or ongoing, suggested by the use of forms such as "has been made", "was made", "is being made" and other similar phrases. Given these phrases generally follow some kind of subject or event, this attention head likely aids in recognizing situations where the past participle "made" is needed to complete the sentence in a grammatically appropriate and semantically meaningful way. Since there appears to be no documents where the attention head is inactive, it's difficult to specify exact conditions under which it would be inactive, but it can be inferred that this would likely be the case in sentences that do not require the usage of the word "made" in a past participle manner following an event or subject..
Examples where the head is active:

(11, 2274, 115), ' them', 0.4444444444444444
This head is active when  contains predictive references to a group or persons conducting or achieving certain actions, or having certain experiences. The head seemingly picks up on scenarios where the referenced individuals are particularly influenced or guided towards a result, such as in the sentences "people have made real progress in work that matters to them" and "the program they are partnered with a skilled advisor who helps them".  This differs from the inactive examples where the term "them" simply references individuals without direct connection to actions leading to substantial changes or outcomes. In sentences such as "Ruby and Jade come over to have tea with her. She takes them to her hideaway: a secret garden", and "also asked other people if it happens to them", "them" is used in a more observational or general context, seemingly not triggering the attention head..

This head is active when  contains sentences that use "down" in an action context, focusing on immediate actions. Words like "shut", "gunned", "placed", "handed", typically precede "down" in these cases. Meanwhile, the head appears to be inactive when "down" isn't immediately associated with action or if the action is presented in more complex temporal or causal contexts (e.g., "when the game shuts down", "was gunned down", "turned upside down"), or implied within larger semantic concepts (e.g., "boils down", "calm down", "track down"). The context of "down" in these inactive examples doesn’t directly imply an immediate action, but rather a state, result, or direction..

This head is active when  uses the word "one" as a substitute for a noun or noun phrase mentioned previously in the text. It is often used after a descriptor or in a contrasting/comparative scenario. The term "one" can refer to a thing, a person, or abstract ideas and is usually used for avoiding repetition in a text. However, when "one" is used more impersonally or indirectly, or in complex sentences where the reference noun is not directly preceding, the attention is inactive..

This head is active when  has a series of actions, descriptions, or explanations followed by a subsequent implication, outcome, or conclusion which frequently is initiated by the word 'then'. In many of these instances, the 'then' is used to show the sequence of events or the resultant effect after a cause. However, there is an element of logical or argumentative progression in the context, unlike in the inactive examples where 'then' is used casually without either detailed explanation of a scenario or an upcoming event of importance. Basically, it is activated when 'then' is used to denote a subsequent important action, conclusion or realization after a detailed background or premise..

It seems to be less active in cases where the word "right" is used within the context of a larger timeframe ("a year from right", "10 years from right").

(11, 2069, 129), ' off', 0.4375
This head is active when  contains a hyphenated word ending with "off" or when "off" is used at the end of a sentence without directly following a verb. This suggests that the attention head is sensitive to specific uses of "off", particularly in relation to compound words or phrases (like "turn-off", "shut-off", "worn-off", "kick-off", etc.) or as single concluding words in sentences ("not shut them off"). Meanwhile, the attention head is inactive when "off" is directly following a verb, forming a phrasal verb such as "shut off", "set off", "wiped off", "phase off", "powered off", indicating the action being taken or executed. Thus, the activation of this attention head highly depends on the grammatical role of "off" in the context..

The phrases often contain words like "other", "various", "number", "many", and directly precede the term "such". This indicates enumeration or classification of items which will follow after "such".

(9, 5, 69), ' too', 0.43137254901960786
This head is active when  contains the structure "so too" or "as too" but in context where it gives continuity or a condition that mirrors the preceding part of the sentence. The phrase often occurs after a comma, showing that the head is attuned to information that expands or parallels what came earlier.   The head also activates for "is good too" or "others will too", where "too" refers back to an adjective or verb mentioned earlier in the text. So it seems this head is activated by a correlation or continuation pattern connected to "too."  In the inactive examples, "as too" is often used incorrectly, or does not provide the same kind of mirroring structure and the term "too" isn't referring to an extension or repetition related to an earlier part of the text. It also does not activate when "too" ends sentences like "I'm happy too"..

This head is active when  describes regular, specific increments of time before the word "every", often referring to a recurring event or action. Additionally, it appears to be more active when the text preceding "every" is a complete clause or sentence, as opposed to a phrase or fragment. The inactive examples often contain more complex sentence structures, varying frequencies, and incomplete segments of information before the term "every" which could be why the attention head is not triggered..

(9, 2250, 88), ' while', 0.42105263157894735
This head is active when  contains a comparison or contrast between two or more entities or situations, often involving statistical data, percentages or quantities. It activates when the next token " while" is used to illustrate a differing perspective, state, conditions or outcomes between these entities/situations. For example, it is frequently activated in sentences expressing contrasting results or outcomes like "Around 60 percent chose portability, while" or "Large format accounted for 18% of the weekend haul, while."   On the other hand, it is inactive when there's not enough context provided to establish a clear contrast like in the example "was the most common (57.1%), while." In this case the sentence likely intends to continue with a contrasting point, but the sentence is cut-off and thus the contrasting information is not fully provided. Therefore the attention head remains inactive..

This head is active when  includes a phrase where a numeric or quantifiable notation (like "six minutes", "dozen", "three", "second", "11", "numerous", "few", "one more", "every", "many", "first", "once") precedes the word "times". This pattern seems to trigger this attention head. However, the head appears to not be activated when there is incorrect grammar usage, such as instances where "time" should be used instead of "times" (e.g. "this times" instead of "this time") or when a quantifier isn't present or mentioned directly before "times"..

(10, 211, 6), ' up', 0.4166666666666667
This head is active when  contains phrases that indicate a past action or state that has resulted in or led to a current condition, often in the form of reminiscing or looking back. This is often marked by verbs in the past tense followed by the preposition "up", like "grew up", "ended up", "wake up". The attention head adds the token " up" to complete these phrases.   Inactive examples do not align with this pattern. In some cases, the verb before "up" is in present or future tense, like "could end up". In other cases, the word "up" is part of a different phrase, like "is made up", where "up" does not follow a past tense verb and does not denote a resultant state or condition. In the inactive examples, the context does not signal the need for the token " up" to complete a phrase indicating a past state leading to a current condition..

This head is active when  contains attempted solutions to a problem or task that have failed or are still ongoing. This is indicated by phrases like "I tried", "I'm still trying", "I followed this guide", etc., followed by the result, usually indicating that the attempted solution "didn't work" or "doesn't work".  In contrast, in the inactive examples, the usage of "work" is often speculative, potential, or in cases where the result of the attempt is not clearly mentioned. Phrases like "might not work", "would work", "wouldn’t work", "know if this plan would work" and "how does it work" specifically do not indicate that an attempt was actually made and failed, consequently making this attention head inactive..

(10, 3032, 11), ' it', 0.4
This head is active when  contains idiomatic phrases or expressions that inherently require the next token to be "it". These are often sentences where the subject "it" was previously established or implied contextually. In addition, the active patterns also include idioms such as "you name it", "think of it", "come to it", etc., which are prevalent in everyday English language usage.   The inactive examples, on the other hand, do not demonstrate such a pattern requiring "it" as the next token. In the inactive examples, the phrase "puts it" is used where "it" refers to something previously mentioned, unlike in the active examples where "it" generally introduces a new idea or phase in the discourse. Furthermore, the phrase "when it" in the inactive examples isn't followed by a definitive idea or suggestion, making the need for "it" less contextually absolute..

This head is active when  refers to a victory, win, or control. The word "over" in the active sentences is usually used to describe a triumph or power one entity has over another. This could be seen in the contexts of sports (wins, victories over), power relations (control, precedence over), and other forms of improvement or advantage (improvement, advantage over). On the contrary, when "over" is used to imply preference or comparison, the attention head becomes inactive..

This could be a variety of things such as company foundations, product launches, meetings, death occurrences, job starts, anniversaries or data collection starts.

This head is active when  contains a description or explanation of a process, event, or condition, and uses "they" as a reference to the previous information. It seems to be particularly attentive to texts where "they" is used to continue a description or explain a consequence or result of previously mentioned concepts or subjects. For instance, this occurs in a variety of contexts, from describing steps in using code, to explaining sequence of events in a story, or detailing a particular aspect of an object or situation.

This head is active when  contains phrases that explain or describe how a certain object, individual, or situation "fits well" or "works well" specifically. In the active samples, there's a direct description of how something operates or accommodates within a certain context, showing functionality or compatibility. For instance, a phrase like "the band fits you well" is active because it's describing how the band fits.   In contrast, the head is inactive when the phrase with "well" is linked with interpersonal relations ("got along well"), an achievement or assessment ("summed it up well", "serves him particularly well") or when it is used in a more passive, less direct structure, especially when "fitting well" is not being directly related to performance, functionality, or compatibility.   For example, phrases like "he fits in well" or "I hope Horns serves the kid just well" are not active because these are more related to individuals integrating into a group or scenario rather than something fitting or functioning.

This head is active when  describes some form of interaction between two entities that involves a mutual or symmetrical relationship or action. This can be a physical interaction (e.g., "move independently from each each"), an emotional interaction (e.g., "We're in love with each each"), or conflict (e.g., "arguing with each each"). The inactive examples usually involved situations where entities were not necessarily mutually interacting or involved more than two entities. Additionally, this attention head also seems to promote 'each' repetition, which is a special construction that is not grammatically correct in standard English but might be a common typo or peculiarity in the texts the model was trained on..

This head is active when  contains the word "shortly" or "immediately" before the token "after" in a sentence, and seems to be particularly attentive to the phrase structure of “<word> shortly after" or "<word> immediately after". When the phrase "shortly after" or "immediately after" starts the sentence (i.e., is at the beginning of the sentence), or when other words are in between "shortly" or immediately and "after" (for example, "on or shortly after", "guts of fourth-instar larvae shortly after", etc.), this attention head stays inactive. Thus, it is highly sensitive to the position and surrounding context of these phrases in a sentence..

This head is active when  is discussing a historical context or the evolution of an event, object, or individual that culminates in or leads to the present day ("today"). The documents where it is active often include some backstory or explanation of how something came to be the way it is in the present, hence triggering the prediction of the next token to be "today". This typically involves historical events, developments or changes leading up to the current state of affairs.  In contrast, the attention head is inactive in documents that merely state current conditions or characteristics of an item or situation, without a detailed narrative or explanation of how that state was reached over time. These documents may refer to "today" or the present time, but without a chronological progression or reference to past events leading up to "today"..

This head is active when  discusses a historical fact, event, or condition that continues or remains relevant up to the present time. One key aspect appears to be the use of the word "still" or other words implying ongoing relevance or continuation, such as "remains" and "is." It also seems to be triggered when referencing previous situations or states that persist or have influences today.   On the other hand, the head is inactive when the documents talk about contrasts between the past and now, the past leading to the present situation, or when usage of "today" is not directly tied to a historical or ongoing fact or occurrence, such as in personal statements. The attention head also seems inactive when the documents discuss relatively modern events or situations (not historical facts), or when the focus is primarily on a past occurrence or state without much implications or connection to the current time..

On the other hand, the attention head is inactive when "her" is used in a context where the action is communicated directly to "her", particularly in dialogues or narratives where someone is telling or showing something to "her."

Conversely, it is inactive when "there are a number" appears in the middle of a sentence without a preceding punctuation or if the preceding statement is not ended yet. It also seems to be inactive when the phrase is not exactly "There are a number", like "as there are a number" or "he is among a number"..
